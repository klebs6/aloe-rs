# Aloe-Codec

Aloe-Codec provides powerful abstractions and implementations for audio encoding and decoding, tailored towards high-performance audio processing systems. By leveraging memory mapping, threaded structures, and format interfaces, this library offers both flexibility and efficiency for developers working with a wide range of audio formats.

## Overview

Aloe-Codec comprises several traits and structs designed for low-level audio data manipulation:

- **MemoryMappedAudioFormatReaderInterface**: Facilitates reading sections of audio files through memory mapping for rapid data access.
- **IncomingDataReceiver**: Provides an interface to receive audio data, manage channel configurations, and integrate incoming blocks into a processing pipeline.
- **AudioFormatWriterInterface**: Defines the means to write audio data in various formats, handling the intricacies of buffer management and data flushing.
- **AudioFormatInterface**: Unifies disparate audio formats under a singular API, enabling query and creation of readers/writers for specific audio needs.

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_codec::{MemoryMappedAudioFormatReaderInterface, AudioFormatInterface};
```

Integrate with audio systems providing memory-mapped reader creation, efficient format management, and advanced data manipulation. Employ threading with `ThreadedWriter` to manage concurrent writes, ensuring smooth performance during high-load operations.

## Key Features

- **Memory Mapping**: Provides rapid data access to audio files by mapping sections into memory efficiently.
- **Format Agnosticity**: Allows for handling diverse audio file formats through unified interfaces.
- **Threaded Processing**: Utilize `ThreadedWriter` for background processing, reducing latency in data-heavy environments.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-codec = "0.1.0"
```
