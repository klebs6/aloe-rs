# Aloe-SIMD-Core

Welcome to the `aloe-simd-core` crate, a high-performance SIMD library designed for efficient vectorized operations in Rust. This crate provides foundational structures and traits for working with SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, leveraging Rust's powerful type system and alignment capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Aligned Structures**: Supports 16-byte alignment for optimized memory access patterns with the `Align16` struct.
- **Vector Types**: Provides various SIMD vector types including `I32FloatSimd4`, `F32Simd4`, `I64DoubleSimd2`, `F64Simd2`, and more for both integer and floating-point operations.
- **Mask Types**: Implements `HasMaskType` for various primitives, facilitating operations like blending and masking within vector computations.
- **Logarithmic Functions**: Includes utility functions such as `log2` for determining the base-2 logarithm of an integer.

## Traits

### `HasMaskType`
Defines an associated mask type for each primitive and complex number, crucial for enabling conditional operations in SIMD programming.

### `PrimitiveType`
Associates a primitive type with complex numbers, allowing seamless integration with Rust's native types.

## Usage

This crate is perfect for developers seeking to implement numerical computations or graphics programming where performance gains are critical. Integrate it into your projects for a robust, high-speed processing foundation.

## Installation

Simply add `aloe-simd-core` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-simd-core = "0.1.0"
```
