Aloe Menus provides a sophisticated, high-performance API for managing graphical user interface (GUI) menu components in Rust. Designed for both desktop and mobile environments, this library offers robust support for complex popup menus, dropdowns, menu bars, and customizable menu items. It leverages advanced Rust features and object-oriented designs to ensure optimal performance and flexibility in creating intricate menu systems.

## Features

- **Popup Menus and Dropdowns**: Create interactive popup menus that can display items in both upwards and downwards directions.
- **Menu Bar Management**: Full support for dynamic menu bars with listener patterns to handle menu updates and item selections.
- **Custom Components and Callbacks**: Easily integrate user-defined components and callback functions for custom behavior on menu item selection.
- **Accessibility and GUI Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with accessibility elements and various GUI frameworks to provide a cohesive user experience.

## Usage Example

To utilize Aloe Menus, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-menus = "0.1.0"
```

Here is a simple example of how to create and display a popup menu:

```rust
use aloe_menus::{PopupMenu, ShowDropdownMenu};

fn show_example_menu() {
    let mut menu = PopupMenu::default();
    menu.add_item_with_text_and_action("Option 1", || println!("Option 1 selected"));
    menu.add_item_with_text_and_action("Option 2", || println!("Option 2 selected"));
    
    let options = PopupMenuOptions::default();
    menu.show_menu_async(&options);
}
```
