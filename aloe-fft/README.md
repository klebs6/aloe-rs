# Aloe-FFT

**Aloe-FFT** is an advanced Rust crate designed to leverage efficient frequency domain convolution using a versatile and extensible FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) engine interface. This crate allows manipulation of digital signals with high performance, enabling real-time audio processing with customizable latency and partitioned algorithms.

## Features
- **Frequency Domain Convolution:** Perform efficient convolution operations in the frequency domain, reducing computational complexity for large impulse responses.
- **Windowing Methods:** Utilize various windowing methods like Hann, Hamming, Blackman, and others to minimize spectral leakage.
- **Convolution Variants:** Options for stereo, trimming, and normalizing convolution settings to accommodate diverse audio processing needs.
- **FFT Engines:** Interface for creating and utilizing FFT instances optimized for different hardware and performance requirements.
- **Background Processing:** Mechanisms for loading impulse responses asynchronously, ensuring smooth real-time processing.

## Usage
To employ the features of **Aloe-FFT**, integrate it into your audio processing pipeline. Create FFT instances and convolution engines for different audio applications, customizing each aspect of the convolution process through the provided interfaces for windowing and impulse response management.

```rust
use aloe_fft::{FftInstance, Convolution, ConvolutionStereo};

// Example of creating a convolution and performing an operation
let mut convolution = Convolution::default();
convolution.load_impulse_response_from_memory(data, size, ConvolutionStereo::yes);
convolution.prepare(&process_spec);

// Process your audio block
convolution.process(&input_context);
```

Ensure efficient audio processing by choosing the right settings and windowing methods. Customize the FFT settings based on your specific needs for latency and IR size.
