# aloe-simd-register-demo

## Overview

The `aloe-simd-register-demo` crate provides an illustrative demonstration of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations within the realm of digital signal processing (DSP) for audio applications. This crate exploits the computational efficiency of SIMD registers to facilitate real-time processing of interleaved audio data. It is designed to enhance the understanding and implementation of IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filtering algorithms, making use of modern Rust features.

## Key Components

- **`SIMDRegisterDemo`**: Acts as the primary interface for managing and visualizing audio files through an `AudioFileReaderComponent`. It defines layout and interactions with its UI component.
- **`SIMDRegisterDemoDSP`**: Contains the core DSP logic, capable of managing audio processing tasks using adjustable IIR filter parameters.

## Usage

Implementations include:

- **Prepare**: Initialize digital filter coefficients and prepare audio blocks based on sampling rate and specific processing requirements.
- **Process**: Execute the main audio processing cycle, efficiently interleaving and deinterleaving audio samples to apply the IIR filter.
- **Reset**: Reinitializes stateful components of the DSP engine.
- **Update Parameters**: Adapt filter parameters based on real-time adjustments via UI sliders for cutoff frequency and bandwidth (Q factor).

## Features

- SIMD-enabled audio processing for increased efficiency.
- Extensive configuration options for real-time audio parameter manipulation.
- Supports low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filtering operations.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-simd-register-demo = "0.1.0"
```

This crate is a translation of the JUCE module.

JUCE is a c++ software framework for developing high performance audio applications.

Usage falls under the GPLv3 as well as the JUCE commercial license.

See github.com/juce-framework/JUCE and the JUCE license page for details.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. As such, some of its features may be pending-translation. For progress updates, please see the workspacer rust project. workspacer contains a growing set of utilities designed specifically for rust projects.
