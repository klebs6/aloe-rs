# Aloe Mac Video Crate

Aloe Mac Video is a Rust crate providing a high-level interface for integrating video playback functionalities, especially designed for macOS and iOS platforms. The crate leverages native multimedia frameworks such as AVFoundation, interfacing through Objective-C, to harness the full potential of video rendering capabilities.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Video Playback:** Seamlessly supports video playback on macOS and iOS by switching between corresponding UIView and NSView components based on the platform.
- **Asynchronous Asset Loading:** Efficiently loads video assets asynchronously, ensuring non-blocking operations and smooth user experiences.
- **Native Control Integration:** Supports native playback controls for macOS environments, providing an intuitive user experience.
- **Customizable Play Speed:** Allows manipulation of playback speed, offering flexibility in media consumption.
- **Observer-Based Notifications:** Utilizes observer patterns to handle player status changes, availing robust media event handling.

## Overview

The crate defines several key types and structures, such as `AVPlayer`, `AVPlayerItem`, `NSView`, and `UIView`, conditionally compiled to ensure compatibility across target platforms. The core player management logic resides in the `PlayerController` and `PlayerAsyncInitialiser` structs, catering to effective resource management and state tracking.

### Main Components

- **PlayerControllerBase:** A foundational structure orchestrating player setup, status observation, and callback management.
- **VideoComponentImpl:** Handles the lifecycle and operations of video components, from loading to playback.
- **Observers and Notification Handling:** Aids in attaching and detaching observers for monitoring player states and responding to changes effectively.

## Usage

To use Aloe Mac Video, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-mac-video = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
extern crate aloe_mac_video;
use aloe_mac_video::{VideoComponentImpl, PlayerController};

fn main() {
    // Initialize your video component
    let mut video_component = VideoComponentImpl::new();
    // Load a video file
    video_component.load_file("path/to/video.mp4").unwrap();
    // Play the video
    video_component.play();
}
```
