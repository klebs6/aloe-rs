# Aloe Live Constant Editor

Aloe Live Constant Editor is a Rust crate designed to dynamically edit and manage constant values during the runtime of an application. The crate facilitates an intuitive GUI-driven approach to altering mutable property fields, enabling developers to modify application behavior without recompilation. 

## Key Functionality

- **Live Value Manipulation**: Utilize the `LiveValueBaseInterface` to manipulate live constants, seamlessly switching between string and numerical representations.
- **Multiple Editors Integration**: Support for various types of editors, including integer sliders, boolean sliders, float sliders, and color selectors via implementations such as `SliderComp` and `ColourEditorComp`.
- **Document Synchronization**: Integrate application behavior with source code management using `CodeDocument` support, ensuring constant values are updated in real-time.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensures thread safety with critical sections, providing robust synchronization across multiple concurrent editor instances.

## Usage Example

```rust
use aloe_live_constant_editor::*;

fn main() {
    let mut code_document = CodeDocument::new();
    let mut live_value = LiveValue::<i32>::new("path/to/file.rs", 42, &100);
    live_value.create_property_component(&mut code_document);
    println!("Current value: {}", live_value.get_string_value(false));
}
```

## API Overview

### Traits

- `LiveValueBaseInterface`: Defines the essential functionality for value manipulation between string and code representations.
- `UpdateRange`: Interface for components such as sliders to dynamically adjust range parameters.

### Structs

- `LivePropertyEditor`: Basic framework for custom editors, supporting a wide range of property types.
- `ValueList`, `ValueListEditorWindow`: Manage and display lists of editable values in a standalone window environment.
