# Aloe Convolution

Aloe Convolution is a Rust crate designed to perform high-quality convolution operations suitable for real-time audio processing applications. It provides a robust framework for performing fast Fourier transform (FFT) based convolution, which is crucial for implementing effects such as cabinet (cab) simulation and reverberation (reverb) in audio processing pipelines.

## Features

- **Modular Convolution Processing:** The crate provides a `ConvolutionProcessor` to manage and streamline the convolution process for both cabinet and reverb effects.
- **Impulse Response Handling:** Load and process impulse response (IR) files efficiently to simulate physical spaces and hardware devices.
- **Dry/Wet Mixing:** Incorporates a `DryWetMixer` to allow flexible blending of dry and processed signals.
- **Latency Management:** Accurately computes the latency introduced by convolution operations, essential for real-time applications.

## Implementation Details

`ConvolutionProcessor` is the core structure of the crate, enabling users to:
- Prepare and reset processing configurations via `prepare` and `reset` methods.
- Execute audio processing with the `process` method, controlling both cabinet and reverb convolutions.
- Accurately assess the inherent latency of convolutions with `get_latency`.

### Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_convolution::ConvolutionProcessor;

fn setup_convolution() {
    // Instantiate the convolution processor
    let mut processor = ConvolutionProcessor::<f32>::default();

    // Prepare the processor with the given specifications
    processor.prepare(&spec);

    // Process audio data in context
    processor.process(&mut context);
}
```
