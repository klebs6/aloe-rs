# Aloe SIMD Native

Aloe SIMD Native provides a suite of highly-optimized SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations for various data types and architectures. Utilizing Rust's low-level capabilities, this crate targets performance-critical tasks, making it ideal for data-intensive applications such as digital signal processing (DSP) and scientific computations.

## Key Features

- **Wide Architecture Support**: Provides intrinsic operations for SSE and platform-specified SIMD capabilities, supporting a range of data types from 8-bit integers to 64-bit floats.
- **Precision and Performance**: Direct utilization of SIMD registers provides unrivaled speed and precision in vectorized mathematical operations.
- **Comprehensive DSP Functions**: Includes essential arithmetic, bitwise, and comparison operations tailored for DSP workflows, enhancing the performance of signal processing tasks.

## Supported Data Types

- `SimdNativeU8`, `SimdNativeU16`, `SimdNativeU32`, `SimdNativeU64`
- `SimdNativeI8`, `SimdNativeI16`, `SimdNativeI32`, `SimdNativeI64`
- `SimdNativeF32`, `SimdNativeF64`

## Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_simd_native::SimdNativeU64;

fn main() {
    let a = SimdNativeU64::expand(5);
    let b = SimdNativeU64::expand(10);
    let result = SimdNativeU64::add(a, b);
    SimdNativeU64::store(result, &mut [0; 2]);
}
```
