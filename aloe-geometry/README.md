# aloe-geometry

Aloe Geometry is a sophisticated Rust library designed to handle complex 2D and 3D geometric transformations, providing a robust set of APIs for graphical applications.

## Features

- **Justification and Border Manipulation**: Utilize enums like `JustificationFlags` to manage text and element alignment efficiently. `BorderSize` allows you to add exact pixel-sized borders to shapes.

- **Quaternion for Rotations**: The library supports `Quaternion`, which facilitates smooth 3D rotations and interpolations, crucial for 3D graphics.

- **Advanced Shape Handling**: `Path`, `Line`, and `Rectangle` structures allow complex shape manipulations, from creating simple lines to managing intricate path shapes using quadratic and cubic curves with support from `Line` and `PathStrokeType` structs.

- **Affine Transforms**: Perform a wide array of affine transformations (`AffineTransform`), such as scaling, rotations, translations, and shearing, perfectly suitable for 2D graphic manipulation.

- **Utility for Rectangles and Polygons**: Easily handle geometric operations on rectangles and parallelograms using `Rectangle` and `Parallelogram` with functions for intersection, unions, and clipping.

- **3D Orientation**: Rotate 3D objects interactively with `Draggable3DOrientation`.

## Usage Example

Here's a small example on using some core features of the library:

```rust
use aloe_geometry::{Path, AffineTransform, JustificationFlags};

let mut my_path = Path::default();
my_path.start_new_sub_path(10.0, 10.0);
my_path.line_to(100.0, 200.0);
my_path.close_sub_path();

let transform = AffineTransform::rotation_about_the_origin(45.0);
my_path.apply_transform(&transform);
```
