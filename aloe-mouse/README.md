# Aloe Mouse

Aloe Mouse is a Rust library designed to manage and manipulate mouse cursor images and interactions. It offers a rich set of features suited for software developers working with GUI applications, providing flexibility in customizing both standard and custom mouse cursors.

## Features

* **Standard Cursors**: A comprehensive enumeration of standard mouse cursor types, enabling easy switching and management.
* **Custom Cursors**: Capability to create custom mouse cursors from image resources, with support for scaling and hotspot configuration.
* **Tooltips**: A fully-featured TooltipClient interface that allows GUI components to implement popup tooltip functionality with ease.
* **Apple Remote Integration**: Exclusive functionality for macOS allowing interaction with Apple Remote Device, facilitating control via remote buttons.

## Usage

To use Aloe Mouse in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-mouse = "0.1.0"
```

### Examples

Creating a standard cursor:

```rust
use aloe_mouse::MouseCursor;
use aloe_mouse::MouseCursorStandardCursorType;

let cursor = MouseCursor::new_from_cursor_type(MouseCursorStandardCursorType::PointingHandCursor);
```

Creating a custom cursor:

```rust
use aloe_mouse::MouseCursor;
use aloe_mouse::CustomMouseCursorInfo;
// Assume `image` is a valid Image object and `hotspot` is a Point<i32>
let custom_cursor = MouseCursor::new_from_image_and_hotspot(image, hotspot_x, hotspot_y);
```
