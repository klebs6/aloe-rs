# Aloe Audio Device Manager

Aloe Audio Device Manager is a sophisticated library aimed at managing audio I/O and MIDI devices seamlessly within Rust applications. It facilitates the creation, management, and configuration of various types of audio devices, leveraging the underlying capabilities of platforms like WASAPI, ASIO, CoreAudio, and others.

## Features
- **WASAPI Device Modes**: Offers multiple modes such as shared, exclusive, and sharedLowLatency for fine-grained audio device control.
- **Device Event Management**: Enables subscribing to device change events to dynamically respond to hardware changes.
- **Comprehensive Device Handling**: Provides interfaces for scanning devices, managing audio device classes, and initializing devices with user-specified options.
- **Audio and MIDI Device Management**: Capable of managing audio and MIDI I/O simultaneously while maintaining smooth operation and configuration transitions.
- **State Preservation**: Serialization support for saving and reloading device setup configurations as XML.

## Usage
The library separates functionality into modules corresponding to different device types and management aspects, allowing the user to interact with only the necessary components:

```rust
use aloe_audio_device_manager::{AudioDeviceManager, AudioIODeviceType};

let mut manager = AudioDeviceManager::default();
manager.initialise_with_default_devices(2, 2).unwrap();
// Register a callback, scan devices, or create a WASAPI device using specific modes.
```

For complete usage, including event listener registration and device-specific operations, refer to the module documentation and examples in the repository.
