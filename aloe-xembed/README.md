# Aloe XEmbed

Aloe XEmbed is a Rust crate designed specifically for embedding foreign X11 widgets on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It provides functionality to integrate widgets from toolkits such as GTK+ and QT, adhering to the XEmbed protocol as outlined in the [freedesktop.org specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/xembed-spec/xembed-spec-latest.html).

## Overview

Aloe XEmbed supports both client-initiated and host-initiated XEmbed protocols:

- **Client Initiated Protocol**: The client creates a window, passing it to the hosting environment.
- **Host Initiated Protocol**: The host creates a window, allowing the client to reparent its widget.

This crate is compatible with GTK+ using `gtk_plug_new` and QT with `QX11EmbedWidget`. Additionally, it supports embedding of raw X11 widgets by following the standard X11 embed protocol.

## Features

- **Wide Compatibility**: Supports GTK+, QT, and other X11 toolkits.
- **Dual Protocol Support**: Seamless handling of both client-initiated and host-initiated XEmbed protocols.
- **Flexible Focus Management**: Customize keyboard focus handling and window resizing behavior.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Compatible with Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.
- **Rust Edition**: 2024

## Usage
To use the crate, first ensure that your build environment is configured to target one of the supported operating systems. Then, you can include the crate in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-xembed = "0.1.0"
```

After adding the dependency, you can embed a X11 widget as follows:

```rust
let xembed_component = aloe_xembed::XEmbedComponent::new(None, None);
// Additional logic and integration...
```

For client-initiated integration:

```rust
let window_id = /* obtain window id from GTK+ or QT */;
let xembed_component = aloe_xembed::XEmbedComponent::new(window_id, true, false);
```
