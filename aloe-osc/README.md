# Aloe OSC

Aloe OSC is a robust Rust crate implementing the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, adhering to the OSC 1.0 specification. This crate allows for efficient and flexible communication of musical and multimedia data over networks. The main features include:

- **OSC Receiver**: Allows you to connect to a network port, receive OSC packets via UDP, parse them, and forward them to listeners.
- **OSC Sender**: Connect to a network port and send OSC messages and bundles to specified hosts over UDP.
- **Pattern Matching**: Supports OSC address pattern matching with wildcards to route messages.
- **Error Handling**: Provides custom error handlers for OSC format errors.
- **Real-time and Message Loop Callbacks**: Supports both real-time critical operations and message loop callbacks for flexible application use.
- **Demo Components**: Comes with demonstration modules illustrating usage.

The crate leverages an extensive, type-safe API and high efficiency suitable for real-time and high-performance environments prevalent in multimedia and electronic music applications. The implementation ensures compliance with the OSC 1.0 specification, making it suitable for various industrial applications, enhancing the communication architecture with real-time guarantees and secured message passing.

## Example Usage
```rust
use aloe_osc::{OSCReceiver, OSCSender, OSCMessage, OSCArgument, OSCAddress, OSCBundle};

// Create and configure an OSC Receiver
let receiver = OSCReceiver::default();
receiver.connect(8000);
receiver.add_listener_message_loop_callback(|msg: &OSCMessage| {
    println!("Received OSC message with address: {}", msg.get_address_pattern());
});

// Create and configure an OSC Sender
let mut sender = OSCSender::default();
sender.connect("192.168.0.1", 8001);
let msg = OSCMessage::from("/osc/test")
    .add_argument(OSCArgument::from(42))
    .add_argument(OSCArgument::from(3.14f32));
sender.send_osc_message(&msg);
```
