# Aloe Waveshaper

Aloe Waveshaper is a Rust crate designed for signal processing, particularly applying waveshaping techniques to audio signals. Waveshaping is a form of nonlinear distortion used in sound synthesis and audio effects processing, allowing for the transformation of input audio signals into a new form by applying a mathematical function.

## Overview

The core functionality of this crate revolves around the `WaveShaper` struct, which can process individual audio samples or blocks of audio using a customizable shaping function. The crate also provides demonstration components to showcase its applications in digital signal processing (DSP).

### Features
- **Parametric Waveshaping**: Customize the waveshaping function using any function that adheres to the `Fn(FloatType) -> FloatType` signature.
- **DSP Components**: Contains demo DSP components for showcasing the use and functionality of the waveshaping algorithms.
- **Sample Processing**: Enables the application of nonlinear transformations to single samples or blocks of audio data.

## Usage

To use the crate, import it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-waveshaper = "0.1.0"
```

In your code, create a `WaveShaper` instance:

```rust
use aloe_waveshaper::create_wave_shaper;

fn custom_shape(x: f32) -> f32 {
    x.tanh()  // Example shaping function
}

let wave_shaper = create_wave_shaper(custom_shape);
```

You can process single samples or entire audio blocks using `process_sample` or `process`, respectively.
