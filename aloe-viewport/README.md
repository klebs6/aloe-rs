# Aloe Viewport

Aloe Viewport is a Rust crate that offers advanced viewport functionalities, allowing seamless scrolling and viewing of large components within a confined space. With integrated scrollbar management and mouse interaction listening, it effectively enables design and development of complex GUI elements.

## Features

- **Dynamic Scrolling**: Automatically adjust visible areas as child components change size.
- **Advanced Event Handling**: Comprehensive mouse and drag event management with `ViewportDragPositionListener` and `MouseListener` traits.
- **Flexible Scrollbar Configuration**: Customizable scrollbar positions, thickness, and visibility for refined control.
- **Proportional Viewing**: Position views as proportions of their movable distances, enabling smooth navigation.
- **Robust Component Management**: Efficiently manage components through sophisticated memory and event handling.

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_viewport::Viewport;

let mut viewport = Viewport::new(Some("my_viewport"));
// Assume `component` is a valid mutable reference to a Component
viewport.set_viewed_component(component, Some(true));
viewport.set_scroll_on_drag_enabled(true);
```

### Handling Mouse Events

Implement various listener traits to handle and respond to mouse activities:

```rust
impl MouseListener for MyMouseListener {
    fn mouse_up(&mut self, event: &MouseEvent) {
        // Your implementation
    }
}
```

### Configuring Scrollbars

Customize scrollbar positioning and appearance:

```rust
viewport.set_scroll_bars_shown(true, true, Some(true), Some(false));
```

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` under dependencies:

```toml
aloe-viewport = "0.1.0"
```
