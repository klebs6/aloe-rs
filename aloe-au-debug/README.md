# aloe-au-debug

`aloe-au-debug` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate logging within applications by providing utilities to dispatch error and warning messages to syslog, with optional stderr output if the application is in debug mode.

## Features
- Log error and warning messages to syslog, a standard logging facility on Unix and Unix-like systems.
- Optionally output to stderr when debugging is enabled, aiding developers in tracing issues during the development phase.

## Interface

### Functions

- **`log_error(fmt: *const u8, args: &[&str])`**: 
  Sends formatted error messages to syslog and optionally to stderr if the application is in debug mode.

- **`log_warning(fmt: *const u8, args: &[&str])`**: 
  Sends formatted warning messages to syslog and optionally to stderr if debugging.

## Usage
Integrating `aloe-au-debug` into your project requires setting up the crate dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-debug = "0.1.0"
```

### Example
```rust
use aloe_au_debug::{log_error, log_warning};

log_error("Error occurred: %s", &["Unexpected behavior"]);
log_warning("Warning: %s", &["Resource usage high"]);
```

This demonstrates how to log error and warning messages, with potential console output in a debug configuration.
