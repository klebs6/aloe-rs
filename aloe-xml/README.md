# Aloe-XML

## Overview

Aloe-XML is an advanced Rust library for handling XML parsing, manipulation, and serialization. Built with the focus on flexible and efficient XML document processing, this crate facilitates the conversion between XML text and structured `XmlElement` objects. With capabilities to parse DTDs for external entity loading, Aloe-XML provides a robust XML manipulation interface sans complete DTD validation.

## Features

- Parse XML strings and files into structured `XmlElement` trees.
- Robust error reporting and parsing customization options.
- Flexible API for setting and retrieving XML attributes.
- Advanced XML iteration and transformation capabilities.
- Serialize `XmlElement` structures back into XML format.

## Usage

To begin using Aloe-XML, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-xml = "0.1.0"
```

### Parsing XML

```rust
use aloe_xml::{XmlDocument, parse_xml_from_string};

fn main() {
    let text = "<root><child>Hello World</child></root>";
    let xml_element = parse_xml_from_string(&text.to_string());
    match xml_element {
        Some(element) => {
            // Work with the XmlElement
        }
        None => {
            eprintln!("Failed to parse XML.");
        }
    }
}
```

### XML Serialization

To convert an `XmlElement` back to XML text:

```rust
let xml_string = xml_element.to_string();
println!("{}", xml_string);
```
