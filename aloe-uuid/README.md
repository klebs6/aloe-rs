# Aloe UUID

`aloe-uuid` is a Rust crate epitomizing the generation and manipulation of universally unique 128-bit identifiers (UUIDs) with compliance to the RFC 4122 version 4 standard. This library is designed for applications necessitating highly unique identifiers, with the assurance of randomness at a molecular level, ensuring virtual impossibility of duplication through chance.

## Overview

At its core, `aloe-uuid` provides functionality to generate, compare, and transform UUIDs into various formats, including raw binary and string representations, with or without dashes. It leverages a 16-byte structure to manage UUID data.

## Features

- **RFC 4122 Version 4 Compliance**: Guarantees unique generation using random numbers and bit manipulations.
- **Versatile Conversions**: Convert to strings, dashed strings, and raw bytes, with support to revert back.
- **Equality and Ordering**: Implements partial and full comparisons along with orderings to enable sorting and equivalence testing.
- **Section Extraction**: Extract integral parts of the UUID such as time, clock sequence, and node.
- **Hashing**: Provides a method to hash the UUID for storage or indexing.

## Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_uuid::Uuid;

let uuid1 = Uuid::default();
let uuid2 = Uuid::from(&"12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc".to_string());

if uuid1 != uuid2 {
    println!("UUIDs are unique!");
}

let raw_data = uuid1.get_raw_data();
let identical_uuid = Uuid::from(raw_data);

assert_eq!(uuid1, identical_uuid);
```

## Installation

Add this line to your `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
aloe-uuid = "0.1.0"
```
