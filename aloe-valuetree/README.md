# Aloe ValueTree

Aloe ValueTree is a sophisticated and extendable crate offering an infrastructure for crafting intricate data trees in Rust. It empowers developers to manage hierarchical data with undo/redo capability while maintaining data integrity through listener notifications.

## Features

- **Tree Data Structure**: Aloe ValueTree is designed for handling free-form data structures that resemble XML trees. Each ValueTree node can have any number of properties and child nodes.
- **Undo/Redo Capabilities**: Modifications to properties and structures within the tree can be tracked and reverted using a connected UndoManager.
- **Reference Counting**: Trees are lightweight references to shared data, thus ensuring efficient memory usage.
- **Listeners**: Enable event-driven programming by allowing listeners to be attached to instances of `Value` and `ValueTree` nodes.
- **Remote Synchronization**: Utilize `ValueTreeSynchroniser` for synchronizing ValueTrees across different platforms by transmitting encoded changes.

## Application
The Aloe ValueTree implementation provides a plethora of traits and structs ensuring fine-grained control over data changes:

- **ValueTreeSynchroniser**: Facilitates state synchronization by encoding changes in a `ValueTree` for remote sharing.
- **ValueListener & ValueTreeListener**: Interfaces for listening to and responding to changes within the `Value` and `ValueTree` structures.
- **CachedValue and ValueWithDefault**: Provide wrapped properties and safeguard against missing tree properties by supplying default values if needed.

## Usage
To effectively harness the power of Aloe ValueTree, you'll implement traits such as `ValueListener` and `ValueTreeListener` to hook into changes within your data structures, and utilize `ValueTreeSynchroniser` to propagate changes over a network architecture.

```rust
impl MyListener {
    fn on_tree_change(&self, tree: &mut ValueTree, property: &Identifier) {
        // Handle the change
    }
}
```
