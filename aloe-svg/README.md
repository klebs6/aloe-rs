# Aloe-SVG

Aloe-SVG is a Rust library designed for efficient parsing and rendering of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files. It provides a comprehensive and robust interface for interpreting SVG elements and paths, facilitating advanced graphical representations. Primarily intended for developers dealing with graphics rendering, this crate leverages Rust's rich type system and performance capabilities to manage SVG structures and drawable objects effortlessly.

## Features
- **SVG Parsing**: Extract and interpret SVG elements from XML files.
- **Path Parsing**: Precise parsing of SVG path data strings into drawable paths.
- **Gradient and Style Management**: Utilize sophisticated operations for gradients, transforms, and styling, ensuring adherence to SVG specifications.

## Usage

### Importing the Crate
To include aloe-svg in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-svg = "0.1.0"
```

### Basic Example

```rust
use aloe_svg::CreateFromSvg;

let svg_data: &XmlElement = ...; // Assume this is your SVG XML Element
let mut drawable = ...; // Instantiate your drawable object
let object = drawable.create_fromsvg(&svg_data);
```

### Advanced Example

```rust
use aloe_svg::{ParseSvgPath, SvgState};

let svg_path_str = "M 10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 L 10 10".to_string();
let mut path = Path::new();
let state = SvgState::new(null, null);
state.parse_svg_path(&mut path, &svg_path_str);
```

## Modules and Traits
- `CreateFromSvg`: Functional interface to create drawable objects from SVG elements.
- `CreateFromSvgFile`: Create drawable constructs directly from SVG files.
- `ParseSvgPath`: Convert SVG path strings into drawable paths using highly optimized parsing algorithms.
