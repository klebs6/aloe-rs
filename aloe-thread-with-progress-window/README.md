# aloe-thread-with-progress-window

## Overview

`aloe-thread-with-progress-window` is a Rust crate designed for multithreading applications that require user feedback through a modal dialog with a progress bar and a cancel button. This enables developers to run concurrent tasks while keeping the user informed about progress.

## Usage

This crate provides the `ThreadWithProgressWindow` structure and relevant traits to manage threading operations with a visual interface. It is particularly useful for long-running tasks that demand user interactivity to allow cancellations or simple progress updates.

### Key Features
- **Progress Monitoring:** The modal window provides real-time progress updates through a visual progress bar.
- **Cancellable Operations:** A cancel button allows users to stop tasks if necessary, handling cancel events seamlessly.
- **User Feedback:** Modify status messages dynamically to keep users informed about ongoing tasks.

### Example

```rust
class MyTask : public ThreadWithProgressWindow {
    MyTask() : ThreadWithProgressWindow("busy...", true, true) {}
    
    void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < thingsToDo; ++i) {
            if (threadShouldExit())
                break;
            setProgress(i / (double)thingsToDo);
            // Perform task...
        }
    }
};

void doTheTask() {
    MyTask m;
    if (m.runThread()) {
        // Thread finished normally
    } else {
        // User pressed the cancel button
    }
}
```

## Technical Details
- **Thread Management:** Built atop Rust threading primitives, ensuring robust and efficient thread handling.
- **Progress Window:** Utilizes a modal alert window to provide a non-intrusive user interface.
- **ThreadComplete Trait:** Notifies when a thread completes execution.
