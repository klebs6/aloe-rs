# Aloe Chorus

Aloe Chorus is a sophisticated digital signal processing (DSP) library, providing a flexible chorus audio effect component that emulates and extends classic analog devices. Through modulation of delay lines, it creates varying notches in the magnitude frequency response, enabling the construction of lush, immersive audio effects.

## Features

- **LFO Modulation:** Modulate the frequency response with precise control over rate and depth.
- **Customizable Delay:** Define the center delay time, accommodating overdriven flange and vibrato effects.
- **Feedback Control:** Adjust feedback from -1 to 1, facilitating diverse sound characterizations.
- **Dry/Wet Mix:** Balance the original and processed audio to create nuanced audio experiences.

## Usage

### Structure

```rust
pub struct Chorus<SampleType: FloatSample> {
    // Internal Components
}
```

### Core Methods

- **process**: Executes signal processing given the context inputs and outputs.
- **set_rate**: Configures the LFO's modulation rate, constrained to sub-100 Hz frequencies.
- **set_depth**: Alters modulation depth within predefined limits.
- **set_centre_delay**: Establishes the core delay of modulation, accommodating flanging and vibrato scenarios.
- **set_feedback**: Develops the delay line feedback for tailored echo textures.
- **set_mix**: Mixes dry and wet signal components to tailor the auditory result.
- **prepare**: Initial preparation of the processor, managing internal specifications.
- **reset**: Clears the processor state for fresh operation.

## Example

To design a classic chorus effect, initialize minimum delay times, and configure the effect parameters:

```rust
let mut chorus = Chorus::<f64>::default();
chorus.set_rate(0.5);
chorus.set_depth(0.2);
chorus.set_centre_delay(7.5);
chorus.set_feedback(0.3);
chorus.set_mix(0.7);
```
