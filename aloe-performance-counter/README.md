# Aloe Performance Counter

Aloe Performance Counter is a sophisticated Rust crate designed for precise and efficient performance monitoring of code segments. It enables users to measure execution time, aggregate statistical data, and log results seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **High-Resolution Timing**: Capture nanosecond-level timing metrics to accurately measure execution durations.
- **Statistical Aggregation**: Analyze performance with averaged metrics over multiple runs, enhancing accuracy.
- **File-Based Logging**: Directly log performance metrics to specified files, ensuring persistence and accessibility.
- **Automated Printouts**: Configure the number of iterations after which averaged statistics are logged automatically.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-performance-counter = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Here is a brief example demonstrating the implementation:

```rust
use aloe_performance_counter::PerformanceCounter;

fn main() {
    let mut pc = PerformanceCounter::new(&"example", Some(50), Some(&std::fs::File::open("/temp/log.txt").unwrap()));
    for _ in 0..1000 {
        pc.start();
        // code segment for performance measurement
        pc.stop();
    }
}
```

## API

- **`PerformanceCounter::new`**: Initializes a new PerformanceCounter object.
- **`start`**: Marks the beginning of the time measurement.
- **`stop`**: Ends the timing and logs statistics if required iterations are reached.
- **`print_statistics`**: Outputs current stats for inspection.
- **`get_statistics_and_reset`**: Retrieves and resets accumulating metrics.
