# Aloe-Variant

Aloe-Variant is a Rust crate providing a flexible mechanism for dynamically typed variant objects akin to those found in scripting languages. It is designed for situations requiring complex data storage and manipulation through primitive and dynamically typed objects while ensuring type safety and extensibility within Rust.

## Features

- **Var**: A versatile variant class for holding primitive values, strings, and dynamically managed objects. Serializable to/from JSON or a proprietary binary format.
- **NamedValueSet**: Stores key-value pairs of `Var` objects, enabling dynamic property retrieval and management.
- **VarNativeFunction**: Defines callable functions with flexible argument handling, facilitating advanced operations and callbacks.

## Usage

This crate leverages Rust's powerful type system to simulate the flexibility of dynamically typed languages. Key structures include:

- **Var**: Acts as the primary storage unit, capable of holding different data types dynamically.
  ```rust
  let mut var = Var::default();
  var = Var::from("A sample string");
  ```

- **NamedValueSet**: Enables storing and retrieving `Var` objects via string identifiers.
  ```rust
  let mut nvs = NamedValueSet::default();
  nvs.set("key", Var::from(42));
  ```

Leverage Aloe-Variant for enhancing Rust applications that require flexibility in data representation while maintaining type safety.
