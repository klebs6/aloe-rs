# Aloe Notifications

Aloe Notifications is a comprehensive Rust library engineered to facilitate the management and utilization of push notifications across various platforms, particularly iOS and Android. Designed for developers seeking a robust solution for handling both remote and local notifications, Aloe Notifications caters to diverse notification needs using well-defined structures and methods. The library integrates seamlessly into your application, ensuring effective communication with users through custom notifications.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Unified interface for iOS and Android, leveraging their notification systems efficiently.
- **Notification Channel Management**: On Android API level 26 or higher, manage channel settings including importance, sound, and vibration.
- **Flexible Notification Configuration**: Customize notifications with actions, icons, priority levels, and more for a tailored user experience.
- **Persistent Settings Management**: Interface for requesting and configuring notification settings, ensuring the application remains compliant with user preferences.
- **Advanced Handling**: Support for grouping, ensuring notifications are presented in an organized manner.
- **Locale-Specific Customization**: Adjust notifications based on device settings and user expectations.

## Usage

Integrate Aloe Notifications into your project by including it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-notifications = "0.1.0"
```

### Example Code

```rust
use aloe_notifications::{PushNotification, PushNotifications};

fn main() {
    let mut push_notifications = PushNotifications::new();
    let notification = PushNotification::default();
    push_notifications.send_local_notification(&notification);
}
```

The above snippet demonstrates basic initialization and usage of the Aloe Notifications library to send a local notification.

## Advanced Configuration

Utilize structures like `PushNotificationSettings` to finely tune the notification behaviors, such as allowing badges, alerts, and sound configurations. Implement the `PushNotifications::setup_channels` method on Android to initialize channels and maintain compliance with newer API requirements.
