# Aloe Math

Aloe Math is a Rust crate dedicated to optimizing arithmetic operations in scientific and engineering applications. Leveraging linear interpolation and Pade approximations, the crate provides fast and memory-efficient techniques for approximate calculations of complex mathematical functions.

## Features

- **Efficient Approximations**: The core feature of Aloe Math is its LookupTable and LookupTableTransform structs, which allow you to define approximations of functions based on pre-calculated data points.
- **Statistics Accumulation**: Collects statistical data series with an emphasis on precision through KahanSum methods to minimize floating point errors.
- **Phase Management and Signal Processing**: Manage phase values that wrap around 2π and process signals in digital signal processing (DSP) tasks.
- **Linear Algebra Built-ins**: Execute operations on matrices for classic arithmetic tasks and solve linear systems efficiently.
- **Fast Function Approximations**: Contains specialized routines for accelerated calculations of hyperbolic and trigonometric functions using approximations.
- **DSP Special Functions**: Provides Bessel functions, elliptical integral computations, and Jacobian elliptic functions for advanced mathematical computations.

## Getting Started

To use Aloe Math, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-math = "0.1.0"
```

## Examples
### LookupTable
```rust
use aloe_math::LookupTable;
let lut = LookupTable::<f64>::new(|x| x.sqrt(), 64);
let value = lut[17];
```

### Matrix Operations
```rust
use aloe_math::Matrix;
let matrix = Matrix::new(3, 3);
let identity = Matrix::identity(3);
```

### FastMathApproximations
```rust
use aloe_math::FastMathApproximations;
let cos_approx = FastMathApproximations::cos(std::f64::consts::PI / 4.0);
```
