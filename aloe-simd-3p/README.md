# Aloe-SIMD-Deps

Aloe-SIMD-Deps is a Rust crate designed for sophisticated numerical computations leveraging SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) parallelism. The crate exposes low-level SIMD functionalities encapsulated in types such as `m8x16`, which is a mask over 16 elements of 8-bit integers.

## Features

- **SIMD Masking**: Utilize the power of SIMD for masked operations on 8-bit integers, optimizing computational efficiency.
- **Advanced Numerical Computations**: Suitable for tasks requiring simultaneous handling of large data sets, best used in performance-critical applications such as scientific computations, data analysis, and real-time simulations.

## Installation

Add Aloe-SIMD-Deps to your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-simd-deps = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Begin by importing the crate and leveraging the `m8x16` type for data manipulation:

```rust
use aloe_simd_3p::m8x16;

fn main() {
    let mask: m8x16 = /* initialize mask */;
    // Use mask in SIMD operations
}
```
