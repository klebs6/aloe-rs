# Aloe-Touch

Aloe-Touch is a Rust crate designed to provide a robust framework for managing multi-touch inputs in a software environment. Leveraging lifetimes and generics, Aloe-Touch offers precise and efficient handling of touch events, facilitating their integration within a graphical interface.

## Features

- **Multi-Touch Mapping:** Utilize `MultiTouchMapper` to efficiently track and manage concurrent touch inputs.
- **Touch Information Handling:** Use `MultiTouchMapperTouchInfo` to encapsulate details about each touch, such as its unique identifier and associated component.
- **Touch State Management:** Functions to check active touches, clear specific touches, or reset touch states.

## Usage

To leverage Aloe-Touch in your project, incorporate the `MultiTouchMapper` to manage your touch events:

```rust
use aloe_touch::MultiTouchMapper;

let mut touch_mapper = MultiTouchMapper::default();

// Example: Add, clear, and check touch events as needed
touch_mapper.get_index_of_touch(peer, touch_id);
assert!(touch_mapper.are_any_touches_active());
touch_mapper.clear_touch(index);
touch_mapper.delete_all_touches_for_peer(peer);
```

## Implementation Details

### MultiTouchMapper

This struct provides the core functionality, encapsulating a vector of `MultiTouchMapperTouchInfo` objects. Through several methods, it enables:

- Locating touches using `get_index_of_touch`.
- Clearing all touches or specific ones using `clear` and `clear_touch`.
- Checking for active touches via `are_any_touches_active`.

### MultiTouchMapperTouchInfo

- **Fields:**
  - `touch_id`: A generic identifier for the touch event.
  - `owner`: A mutable reference to the associated `ComponentPeer`.

- **Traits:** Implements `Default`, `PartialEq`, and `Eq` for seamless comparison and default state management.
