# aloe-char

Aloe-char is a Rust crate designed for developers requiring advanced manipulation of character encodings within strings. It provides robust utilities for handling UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, and ASCII encodings. With a focus on flexibility, the crate allows you to switch internal storage formats, enabling optimized memory usage or rapid indexing.

## Features

- **Character Pointer Implementations**: Abstract data structures (`CharPointer_UTF32`, `CharPointer_UTF16`, `CharPointer_UTF8`, `CharPointer_ASCII`) help manipulate null-terminated strings.
- **Flexible Encoding Types**: Change the internal encoding type via `ALOE_STRING_UTF_TYPE` to suit specific memory and performance needs.
- **Support for ASCII and UTF Character Sets**: Efficient operations across various encoding types such as length calculation, pointer arithmetic, and character comparison.
- **Conversion Functions**: Seamlessly convert between UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 through `toUTF8()`, `toUTF16()`, `toUTF32()` methods.
- **Atomic Operations**: Safe manipulation of character pointers through atomic swaps.

## Getting Started

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-char = "0.1.0"
```

Utilize the character pointer structures to navigate strings effectively within your application logic. Tailor the Unicode encoding by setting the desired `ALOE_STRING_UTF_TYPE` configuration at compile time.

## Usage

```rust
// Example of creating and manipulating a UTF-32 character pointer
use aloe_char::CharPointer_UTF32;

fn main() {
    let mut pointer = CharPointer_UTF32::new(raw_utf32_pointer);
    pointer.write('A');
    println!("Character: {}", *pointer);
}
```
