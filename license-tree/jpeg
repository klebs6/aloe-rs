 INDEPENDENT JPEG GROUP (IJG) LICENSE CLUSTER - SINGLE COMMENT BLOCK

 This unified text covers the standard IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licensing
 statements repeated in the original snippet across multiple files, such as:
   jcapimin.c, jcapistd.c, jccoefct.c, jcdctmgr.c, jchuff.c, jcinit.c, etc.,
   as well as jerror.h, jerror.c, and the "README" references typically found
   in an IJG distribution.

 The authors commonly appear as: Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding, and the
 Independent JPEG Group. Key references show the years 1991-1998, among others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The typical license statement used by the IJG is:

   This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

   Copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
   This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.

   For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
   (Often also referencing "jerror.h" or "jerror.c" for error code details.)

   The gist of the terms is that the software is provided "AS IS", with no
   warranty of any kind, express or implied.  Permission to use, copy,
   modify, and distribute this software for any purpose without fee is
   granted, as long as certain conditions in the README are met.  The
   disclaimers disclaim all warranties, including merchantability and fitness
   for a particular purpose, and disclaim liability for any damages.

 Over time, additional statements or disclaimers might appear, but they all
 revolve around the same core license used by the IJG. The key points are:

   1) This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
   2) Permission is granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software
      for any purpose, subject to the disclaimers in the README.
   3) The authors disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of
      merchantability and fitness.

 For complete details, please refer to the official Independent JPEG Group
 documentation and the README included with the source distribution.

 Consolidated here, it forms a single robust license cluster for the IJG code.
