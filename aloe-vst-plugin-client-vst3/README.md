# Aloe VST Plugin Client VST3

Aloe VST Plugin Client VST3 is a robust Rust library designed for efficient interaction and integration with VST3 interfaces. This crate leverages advanced Rust concepts and idiomatic patterns to effectively manage VST3 plugins' life cycle, parameter manipulation, and interface interaction. It is optimized for high-performance audio processing workflows typically encountered in professional audio software environments.

## Features

- Defines and manipulates VST3 plugin parameters through Rust's safe and performant abstractions.
- Provides utilities for interfacing with `VstIHostApplication` and managing audio buffers of varying bit depths.
- Supports handling of MIDI controller assignments, facilitating complex MIDI interfacing.
- Includes robust mechanisms for memory management via compile-time and runtime features.

## Getting Started

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-vst-plugin-client-vst3 = "0.1.0"
```

Use it within your Rust code:

```rust
use aloe_vst_plugin_client_vst3::{AloeAudioProcessorInternalParameters, AudioBusPointerHelper};

fn main() {
    // Implement your audio processor logic here
}
```

## Usage

This crate exposes traits and structs meant for creating and manipulating VST3 plugins. Users can create instances of `AloeAudioProcessor` and interact with host applications through VST3's `CreateFunction` type alias to bind plugin functionality.

### Example

```rust
// Example showing basic usage of AloeAudioProcessor
use aloe_vst_plugin_client_vst3::{AloeAudioProcessor, CreateFunction};

let my_processor = AloeAudioProcessor::new(/* Plugin Interface */);
// Configure your processor, connect to host, etc.
```

## Advanced Usage

For complex applications involving MIDI and custom parameter mapping, users should implement traits such as `ChooseBufferHelper` and `AudioBusPointerHelper`. This allows fine-grained control over audio data handling.
