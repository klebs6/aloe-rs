# Aloe-Core

Aloe-Core is a Rust crate designed as a bridge to facilitate seamless interaction between Rust and Objective-C environments, with a strong focus on command line applications. This crate offers a robust set of utilities for dealing with Objective-C objects, blocks, and memory management, allowing Rust programs to effectively manage Objective-C references with the benefit of Rust’s safety guarantees.

## Key Features
- **Command-line Parsing:** Provides a straightforward interface to manage and interpret command-line arguments within console applications through `ArgumentList` and `ConsoleApplication` structs.
- **Objective-C Interoperability:** Safely interact with Objective-C objects and classes with Rust idioms, supporting memory-managed interactions via `ObjCClass` and `ObjCLifetimeManagedClass`.
- **System Utilities:** Integrate filesystem checks and system command execution efficiently in POSIX environments.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-core = "0.1.0"
```

## Example Usage
Create a simple command-line application:
```rust
use aloe_core::ConsoleApplication;

fn main(argc: i32, argv: *mut &[u8]) {
    let mut app = ConsoleApplication::default();
    app.add_help_command("--help|-h", "Usage: app [options]", true);
    app.add_version_command("--version|-v", "App version 0.1.0");
    app.add_command(...);
    app.find_and_run_command(argc, argv);
}
```

## Safety Considerations
This crate assumes Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is enabled. Users must ensure that Objective-C objects are properly managed to prevent memory leaks. The integration with Objective-C includes considerations for safe memory handling in mixed-language applications.
