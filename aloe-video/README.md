# Aloe Video

Welcome to the Aloe Video crate, a sophisticated Rust library engineered for seamless video playback control and management across multiple platforms.

## Overview
Aloe Video provides a comprehensive component for handling video playback through the [VideoComponent](#structure) structure. It abstracts various operations such as loading from local files and URLs, asynchronous content loading, playback control (play, stop, pause), and video attribute queries like duration, size, and playback speed.

### Key Features
- Multi-platform support: Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.
- Asynchronous video loading and callbacks.
- Native or custom UI component integration.
- Rich video control methods: play, pause, stop, and speed adjustments.
- Query functions for current playback status and video properties.

## Usage
To utilize Aloe Video in your project, implement the trait `VideoComponentImplInterface` for custom video handling logic and integrate `VideoComponent` into your application.

```rust
use aloe_video::{VideoComponent, VideoComponentImplInterface};

struct MyVideoComponent;
impl VideoComponentImplInterface for MyVideoComponent {}

fn main() {
    let mut video = VideoComponent::new(true);
    video.load_async("http://example.com/video.mp4", |url, result| {
        match result {
            Ok(_) => println!("Video loaded successfully from {url}"),
            Err(_) => println!("Error loading video from {url}"),
        }
    });
    video.play();
}
```

## Detailed API Documentation
Aloe Video's extensive set of methods allows fine control and status checks:
- `load_file(&mut self, file: &File)`: Load from a local file.
- `load_url(&mut self, url: &Url)`: Load video from a URL.
- `play(&mut self)`: Start video playback.
- `stop(&mut self)`: Stop video playback.
- `set_play_speed(&mut self, new_speed: f64)`: Adjust playback speed.
- More method details available in inline documentation.
