# Aloe Panner Crate

The **Aloe Panner** Rust crate implements advanced digital audio panning techniques for stereo audio signals, utilizing customizable panning rules for precision sound positioning. This crate offers diverse mappings such as linear, balanced, sinusoidal, and square root mappings to control stereo channels dynamically, catering to nuanced audio processing applications.

## Features
- **Panner Rules:** Multiple algorithms for panning behavior, including Linear, Balanced, Sinusoidal, and Square Root variants, each delivering unique auditory effects.
- **Customizable Panning Values:** Adjusts seamlessly between -1 (full left) and 1 (full right).
- **Optimization for DSP:** Designed with Digital Signal Processing principles at its core to ensure optimal performance in audio applications with smooth transitions and efficient computation.

## Panner Rules Explained
The panning rules provided by this crate each have distinct characteristics tailored for different auditory outcomes:
- **Linear:** Direct proportional volumes.
- **Balanced:** Equal power across the pan range.
- **Sin3dB / Sin4.5dB / Sin6dB:** Sinusoidal attenuation with varying curves.
- **SquareRoot3dB / SquareRoot4.5dB:** Non-linear attenuation using square root functions.

## Getting Started
```rust
use aloe_panner::{Panner, PannerRule};

fn main() {
    let mut panner = Panner::default();
    panner.set_rule(PannerRule::Sin6dB);
    panner.set_pan(0.5);
    // Processing context would be passed here
}
```
