# Aloe VST REAPER

Aloe VST REAPER provides an advanced, efficient interface for embedding and managing VST plugins within the REAPER digital audio workstation. This crate is designed for seamless integration, offering an API for communication with REAPER's host application and UI embedding capabilities.

## Features
- **IReaperHostApplication**: Interface to access REAPER API functions and parent windows. 
- **IReaperUIEmbedInterface**: Provides UI embedding functionalities for enhanced plugin control.

## Usage
To utilize this crate, implement the `IReaperHostApplication` and `IReaperUIEmbedInterface` traits in your application. This will allow your VST plugins to interact with REAPER's functionality and extend your plugin's UI capabilities.

### Example:
```rust
use std::ffi::CString;
use std::ptr;

struct MyReaperPlugin;

impl IReaperHostApplication for MyReaperPlugin {
    fn get_reaper_api(&mut self, funcname: CString) {
        // Implementation...
    }

    fn get_reaper_parent(&mut self, w: u32) {
        // Implementation...
    }

    fn reaper_extended(&mut self, call: u32, parm1: *mut std::ffi::c_void, parm2: *mut std::ffi::c_void, parm3: *mut std::ffi::c_void) {
        // Implementation...
    }
}

impl IReaperUIEmbedInterface for MyReaperPlugin {
    fn embed_message(&mut self, msg: i32, parm2: isize, parm3: isize) -> isize {
        // Implementation...
        return 0;
    }
}
```

## Requirements
- REAPER version 5.02 or higher.
