# Aloe FFT Demo

The `aloe-fft-demo` crate is designed to provide a sophisticated demonstration of real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processing within Rust. It employs FFT to visualize audio signals through a dynamic spectrogram. This crate is particularly beneficial for users interested in audio signal processing, visualization, and transformations.

## Features
- **Real-Time Audio Processing:** The `SimpleFFTDemo` struct enables real-time audio capture and FFT processing on the incoming audio stream.
- **Spectrogram Visualization:** Captures and visualizes the frequency domain representation via spectrogram images.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Utilizes a circular FIFO buffer for efficient sample data handling, ensuring low-latency processing.

## Usage
To leverage the functionalities provided by this crate, instantiate `SimpleFFTDemo` within your application and invoke methods such as `prepare_to_play`, `get_next_audio_block`, and `paint` for rendering. Here is a succinct example:

```rust
use aloe_fft_demo::SimpleFFTDemo;

fn main() {
    let mut fft_demo = SimpleFFTDemo::default();
    // Configure your audio system, and begin processing
}
```

## Technical Insights
This crate employs the Fast Fourier Transform to convert time-domain signal samples into frequency-domain data. The `draw_next_line_of_spectrogram` method efficiently shifts existing image data and renders new FFT results, providing a scrolling spectrogram effect.

The implementation leverages:
- **Optimized FFT Transform:** Through frequency-only forward transformations for rapid calculations.
- **FIFO and FFT Data Buffers:** Specifically sized for seamless handling of sample data and transform operations.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-fft-demo = "0.1.0"
```
