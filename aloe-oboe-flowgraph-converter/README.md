# Aloe Oboe Flowgraph Converter

A sophisticated Rust crate designed for PCM data handling, the `aloe-oboe-flowgraph-converter` orchestrates PCM channel, sample rate, and format conversion to maintain optimal latency. Its modular design leverages flow graph architecture to facilitate intricate conversions between varied audio configurations, effectively catering to complex audio-processing scenarios.

## Core Features

- **Channel Conversion**: Flexibly converts between multi-channel interleaved streams and monophonic streams, handling both increases and decreases in channel count without the necessity of mixing.
- **Resampling Techniques**: Employs advanced resampling strategies through the `SampleRateConverter` component to ensure precision during sample rate transformations.
- **Latency Optimization**: Tailors conversions to uphold latency requirements integral to high-performance audio applications.
- **Flowgraph Architecture**: Facilitates an interconnected module setup, ensuring seamless data streaming from source to sink.

## Example Usage

The crate provides an intuitive API structure for the assembly of the data conversion flowgraph:

```rust
use aloe_oboe_flowgraph_converter::DataConversionFlowGraph;

fn main() {
    let mut flowgraph = DataConversionFlowGraph::default();
    // Example configuration and usage.
    // flowgraph.configure(source_stream, sink_stream);
}
```

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-flowgraph-converter = "0.1.0"
```
