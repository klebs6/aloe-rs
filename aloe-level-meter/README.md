# Aloe Level Meter

Aloe Level Meter is a high-performance, reference-counted level metering crate designed for audio processing in Rust. The crate provides an atomic and efficient way to monitor and update audio levels dynamically. It features a `LevelMeter` struct, utilized to ensure level processing is conducted only when actively referenced, enhancing computational efficiency.

## Features

- **Atomic Level Storage**: Uses `Atomic<f32>` for safe concurrent updates without locks.
- **Efficient Level Calculation**: Includes optimized processes for calculating and maintaining audio levels, leveraging decay and averaging strategies used in professional audio tools.
- **Reference-Counting**: By utilizing `Rc<RefCell<LevelMeter>>`, the crate ensures the efficient execution of level computations only when necessary.

## Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_level_meter::{LevelMeter, LevelMeterPtr};
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

let meter = Rc::new(RefCell::new(LevelMeter::default()));
// Update the level with audio data
// meter.borrow_mut().update_level(channel_data, num_channels, num_samples);
// Retrieve current level
// let current_level = meter.borrow().get_current_level();
```

## Functionality

- `update_level`: Accepts raw audio channel data and computes the average signal level. Decay is applied to emulate natural audio fade, ensuring the visual level meter reflects realistic audio behaviors.
- `get_current_level`: Retrieves the most recent computed audio level as a floating-point value.

## Installation
Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-level-meter = "0.1.0"
```
