# Aloe Drag and Drop

Aloe Drag and Drop is a sophisticated Rust crate designed to facilitate seamless drag-and-drop interactions within GUI applications. This crate provides extensive support for drag-and-drop operations involving files, text, and custom components, both internally within applications and across different applications via external drag-and-drop.

## Features

- **File Drag-and-Drop**: Enables components to receive files from external sources through drag-and-drop events.
- **Text Drag-and-Drop**: Supports dragging of textual data, allowing components to handle dropped text.
- **Custom Component Dragging**: Provides a comprehensive interface for dragging complex objects within a GUI, with support for custom drag images and constraints on component movement.
- **External Drag-and-Drop Support**: Facilitates interaction with the operating system's drag-and-drop mechanisms to move files or text between applications.

## Usage

Implement the necessary traits such as `FileDragAndDropTarget`, `TextDragAndDropTarget`, or `DragAndDropTarget` within your components to enable drag-and-drop functionality. Utilize methods such as `start_dragging_component` within mouse event handlers to initiate drag operations.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_drag_and_drop::{ComponentDragger, DragAndDropContainer};

struct MyComponent {
    dragger: ComponentDragger,
}

impl MyComponent {
    fn on_mouse_down(&mut self) {
        self.dragger.start_dragging_component(self, ...);
    }

    fn on_mouse_drag(&mut self) {
        self.dragger.drag_component(self, ...);
    }
}
```

### Advanced Operations

- **Using Drag Image**: Customize the drag image shown during a drag-and-drop operation by using `set_current_drag_image`.
- **External Drag-and-Drop Initiation**: Start drag-and-drop operations with external applications using methods like `perform_external_drag_drop_of_files` or `perform_external_drag_drop_of_text`.

**Note:** When dealing with external drag-and-drops, consider platform-specific functionality and constraints.
