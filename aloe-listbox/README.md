# Aloe ListBox

Aloe ListBox is a Rust crate that facilitates the creation and management of a sophisticated GUI list box, drawing extensively on graphical user interface paradigms. It is engineered to provide fine-grained control over list items, including selection, event handling, and rendering.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: Utilize `ListBoxColourIds` to customize the color of list components via `Component::setColour` or `LookAndFeel::setColour`.

- **Dynamic Row Management**: Embed flexible row update mechanisms and track dynamic content changes using `ListBoxModel`.

- **Extensive Event Handling**: A suite of traits (`ListBoxItemClicked`, `ListBoxItemDoubleClicked`, `BackgroundClicked`, etc.) for handling mouse interactions, keyboard entries, and item selections.

- **Accessibility Support**: Supports comprehensive accessibility features using `RowAccessibilityHandler`, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.

- **Snapshot Capabilities**: Capture images of list rows through `CreateSnapshotOfRows` for enhanced integration with drag-and-drop interfaces.

- **Scroll and View Management**: Navigate smoothly across list items with efficient scroll handling leveraging `ListViewport`.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-listbox = "0.1.0"
```

Define your own structs implementing traits like `ListBoxModelInterface`, `GetNumRows`, and use `ListBox` for rendering lists in your GUI application.

```rust
use aloe_listbox::{ListBox, ListBoxModel, ListBoxModelInterface};

#[derive(Default)]
struct MyListModel;

impl ListBoxModelInterface for MyListModel {
    // Implement necessary traits
}

fn main() {
    let model = MyListModel::default();
    let mut listbox = ListBox::new(String::from("my_list"), &model);
    // Configure listbox and integrate into your UI system
}
```
