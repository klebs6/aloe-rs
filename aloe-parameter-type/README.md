# Aloe Parameter Type

Welcome to the `aloe-parameter-type` Rust crate, a nuanced and refined library engineered to handle parameterization and type abstraction with elegance. Designed for developers who require precise control and a robust framework for managing parameter types and their characteristics.

## Features

- **Parameter Traits**: Implements `HasParameters`, `HasParametersPtr`, and `ParameterType` traits enabling parameter management with precision.
- **Type Abstraction**: Provides `HasFloatType`, `SmallestFloatType`, and `UnsignedTypeWithSize` traits for intricate type manipulation and guarantees on numeric data representation.
- **Inclusive Implementations**: Covers a diverse range of primitive types (e.g., `char`, `bool`, numeric types) ensuring comprehensive utility across applications.

## Getting Started

Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` to take advantage of this sophisticated crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-parameter-type = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_parameter_type::*;

struct MyStruct;
impl HasParameters for MyStruct {
    type Parameters = (u32, f32);
}

impl HasFloatType for MyStruct {
    type FloatType = f32;
}
```
