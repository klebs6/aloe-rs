# Aloe Threads

Aloe Threads is a robust Rust crate providing advanced multithreading utilities and structures optimized for high performance concurrent operations. The crate encompasses an extensive thread pool implementation capable of executing complex workloads efficiently across multiple threads.

## Key Components

### ThreadPool
A ThreadPool manages a collection of threads to execute jobs concurrently. It supports dynamic thread management, allowing fine-tuned control over task execution priorities and job scheduling.

- **ThreadPoolJob**: Defines the unit of work within the thread pool. Implement the `run_job` method to define job behavior.
- **ThreadPoolJobStatus**: Governs job execution flow, using statuses like `jobHasFinished` or `jobNeedsRunningAgain`.

### Synchronization Primitives
- **ReadWriteLock**: Supports multiple concurrent readers or a single writer, facilitating efficient data access management.
- **SpinLock**: A lightweight, non-reentrant lock for low-contention synchronization.
- **WaitableEvent**: Allows threads to block until a specific condition is met, crucial for thread synchronization.

### Timer
- **HighResolutionTimer**: Provides high-precision timing capabilities through a dedicated thread, essential for time-critical applications.

### Miscellaneous
- **DynamicLibrary**: Facilitates dynamic loading and unloading of shared libraries, managing function pointers with RAII.
- **ChildProcess**: Launches and interacts with child processes, capturing standard output and monitoring process state.

## Usage
To utilize the full potential of Aloe Threads, integrate this crate into your project and leverage its defined traits and structs for concurrency management.

```rust
use aloe_threads::ThreadPool;
```
