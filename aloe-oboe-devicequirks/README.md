# Aloe Oboe Device Quirks

## Overview
Aloe Oboe Device Quirks is a Rust library designed for internal use, providing capability to handle device-specific audio quirks. Primarily aimed at Android developers utilizing Rust, the library offers mechanisms for effectively managing audio stream configurations, debugging, and optimizing audio latency issues, especially on Samsung devices equipped with Exynos chips.

### Features
- **Device Manufacturer Handling**: Tailored handling of specific quirks based on device manufacturers, particularly Samsung.
- **Audio Stream Management**: Efficient management and tuning of audio buffer sizes for low latency streaming.
- **Mono and Stereo Channel Handling**: Correction for devices where mono can inadvertently be stereo due to device firmware issues.
- **Supports MMAP**: Conditional utilization of Memory Mapped Audio Protocol for audio streams.

## Technical Details
The crate encapsulates several core structs: `OboeDeviceQuirks`, `SamsungDeviceQuirks`, and `OboeQuirksManager`. It focuses on the following:

- **Exynos-specific Handling**: The `SamsungDeviceQuirks` struct provides logic to accommodate audio issues prevalent in Exynos chipsets, such as timing model glitches and mono/stereo mismatches in certain chipsets.
- **Low Latency Support**: Supports features like clipping of buffer sizes and format conversions for achieving optimal latency levels when streaming audio in Android applications.

## Usage
Below is a short template to demonstrate usage patterns for incorporating `aloe-oboe-devicequirks` into your application:

```rust
use aloe_oboe_devicequirks::{OboeQuirksManager, AudioStreamBuilder};

fn main() {
    let mut quirks_manager = OboeQuirksManager::get_instance();
    let mut builder = AudioStreamBuilder::new();

    if quirks_manager.is_mmap_safe(&mut builder) {
        // Code to handle safe MMAP usage
    }
}
```
