# Aloe BigInt

## Overview
Aloe BigInt is a Rust library that provides an arbitrarily large integer class, `BigInteger`, allowing for mathematical computations beyond the bounds of traditional integer types. The class supports standard integer operations, bit-wise manipulations, and features such as GCD computation and modular arithmetic.

## Technical Details
The `BigInteger` struct handles large numbers not constrained by bit width, aside from memory and performance limitations. Negative values are supported, although the underlying representation does not use 2's complement.

### Key Features
- **Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic**: Perform arithmetic with numbers of any size, leveraging memory allocation for extended precision.
- **Bit-wise Operations**: Includes bit manipulation methods such as shifting, bit-wise AND, OR, XOR, and specific bit-set functionality.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Supports operations like exponentiation modulo and inverse modulo, essential for cryptographic calculations.
- **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: Computes GCD and aids in modular inversion calculations.

### Usage
To use Aloe BigInt, include the following in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-bigint = "0.1.0"
```

### Examples
```rust
use aloe_bigint::BigInteger;

// Creating a BigInteger instance
tlet mut big1 = BigInteger::new_from_i32(123);
let big2 = BigInteger::new_from_u32(456);

// Arithmetic operations
big1 += &big2;
big1 *= big2;

// Modular arithmetic
big1.exponent_modulo(&big2, &BigInteger::new_from_u32(789));

// Display the result
println!("Result: {}", big1);
```
