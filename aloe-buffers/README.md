# aloe-buffers

`aloe-buffers` is an advanced Rust library designed for audio processing tasks, specifically for managing multi-channel audio data with a focus on flexibility and performance. The crate provides a set of types and traits that facilitate the conversion and management of various audio formats and types, supporting targeted operations on audio data such as conversion between integer and float formats, channel management, and complex transformation operations.

## Features

- **Audio Channel Management:** Define and handle various audio channel types through `AudioChannelType` enumeration, supporting a wide range of setups, including surround sound configurations and ambisonics.
- **Sample Format Conversion:** Convert between audio data formats such as `int16`, `int24`, `int32`, `float32` in both little-endian and big-endian orders using `Converter` and `AudioDataPointer` types.
- **High-Performance Audio Buffer:** Efficiently manage audio samples with `AudioBuffer` that supports dynamic channel configuration and sample processing tasks.
- **Precision Vector Operations:** Perform detailed vector operations and transformations on floating-point data with optimization for various CPU architectures including SSE and ARM NEON.

## Usage

To integrate `aloe-buffers` into your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-buffers = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use aloe_buffers::{AudioChannelType, AudioBuffer};

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = AudioBuffer::<f32>::new(2, 1024);  // 2 channels, 1024 samples each
    buffer.apply_gain(0.5);                             // Apply a gain of 0.5 to all samples
    
    println!("Updated first channel first sample: {}", buffer.get_write_pointer_from_channel_number(0)[0]);
}
```
