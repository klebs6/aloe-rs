# Aloe Camera

Aloe Camera provides a sophisticated and efficient interface to manage camera devices for video capture and still-image acquisition. Specially designed for high-performance multi-threaded environments, this crate extends robust support for real-time image processing applications on Android and iOS platforms.

## Overview

Aloe Camera allows you to control any video capture devices available on your system. It offers asynchronous device management, ensuring flexible integration without blocking main threads.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Image Processing**: Implement `CameraDeviceListener` trait to receive callbacks with individual frames, enabling quick and efficient image processing.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Seamlessly manage camera devices on both Android and iOS platforms. Multi-threaded callbacks and asynchronous operations make integration fluid and efficient.
- **Video and Image Capture**: Designed for both video streaming and still image capture with methods to handle quality preferences and resolution constraints.
- **Dynamic Device Management**: Enumerate and access available camera devices using flexible synchronous and asynchronous methods.

### Usage

1. **List Available Devices**: Identify devices connected to your system with `getAvailableDevices()`.
2. **Open a Device**:
   - Use `openDevice()` for synchronous operations (not supported on iOS/Android).
   - Use `openDeviceAsync()` for asynchronous operations on all platforms.
3. **Capture Images/Video**:
   - Implement `CameraDeviceListener` to process video frames in real-time.
   - Use `takeStillPicture()` to capture high-quality still images.
   - Call `startRecordingToFile()` to begin high-resolution video recording.
4. **Manage Listeners**: Efficiently add or remove listeners using `addListener()` and `removeListener()`.

Developers interested in optimizing their multimedia applications for portable platforms will benefit greatly from Aloe Camera's advanced abstraction and high-level utilities.
