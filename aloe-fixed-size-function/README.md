# Aloe Fixed Size Function

Aloe Fixed Size Function is a Rust crate that provides a type similar to `std::function`. This crate is optimized for real-time contexts as it ensures that a callable object is stored in a pre-allocated buffer. This approach eliminates runtime allocation, thereby enhancing performance in environments where allocation overhead is undesirable.

## Features

- **Fixed Size Buffer**: Callable objects are stored in an internal buffer defined by a constant size parameter `LEN`, ensuring constant memory usage.
- **Realtime Optimization**: Avoids dynamic memory allocation, making it suitable for DSP and other time-sensitive applications.
- **Generic Implementation**: Supports generic return types and arguments, making it versatile for various functional interfaces.

## Usage

To use `Aloe Fixed Size Function`, instantiate it with a buffer size, return type, and argument type:

```rust
let fixed_func = FixedSizeFunction::<64, i32, (i32,)>::new(|x| x + 1);

if fixed_func.is_callable() {
    let result = fixed_func.call((5,));
    assert_eq!(result, 6);
}
```

### Safety

Ensure that the function fits within the specified buffer length and respects alignment requirements. The assert statements in the implementation enforce these constraints during instantiation.
