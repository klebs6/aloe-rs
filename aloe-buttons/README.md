# Aloe Buttons

Aloe Buttons is a sophisticated Rust library designed for creating versatile and highly customizable button components in graphical user interfaces. This crate offers a plethora of button structures, encompassing various styles and functionalities, making it ideal for complex UI design requirements.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Button Styles**: Includes `ImageButton`, `TextButton`, `ArrowButton`, `HyperlinkButton`, `ShapeButton`, `DrawableButton`, and `ToggleButton`, each offering unique visual and functional characteristics.
- **Customization Options**: Extensive control over button appearance through `ButtonColourIds`, `DrawableButtonStyle`, and `ButtonConnectedEdgeFlags` enums, allowing for precise customization of button aesthetics and behavior.
- **State Management**: Robust management of button states (`ButtonState`), enabling dynamic appearance changes in response to user interactions.
- **Accessibility Support**: Includes `ButtonAccessibilityHandler`, ensuring that UI components are accessible to all users, following modern accessibility standards.

// Set button propertiesmy_button.set_button_text(&String::from("Press Here"));
my_button.set_tooltip(&String::from("This is a text button"));

// Implement button click listener
impl ButtonListener for MyButtonListener {
    fn button_clicked(&mut self, button: *mut Button) {
