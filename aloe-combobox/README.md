# Aloe ComboBox

`aloe-combobox` is a Rust crate providing a sophisticated and customizable combo box component designed for graphical user interfaces. This crate enables developers to integrate drop-down selection elements capable of handling both non-editable and editable text for user interaction in applications.

## Features

- **Editable and Non-editable Text**: Configure the ComboBox to display text that can be either static or user-editable.
- **Event Handling**: Register event listeners to respond to user interactions when the selected item changes.
- **Item Management**: Add, remove, and manage items within the ComboBox's drop-down list with unique IDs.
- **Accessibility Support**: Enhanced with accessibility utilities to aid users with disabilities.
- **Customizable Popup**: Leverage the look and feel system to render and control combo-box popups.

## Example Usage
To use `aloe-combobox`, include it in your Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-combobox = "0.1.0"
```

Below is a simple example of how to instantiate and manage an `aloe-combobox`:
```rust
use aloe_combobox::{ComboBox, ComboBoxListener, ComboBoxEditableState};

// Create a ComboBox instance
define_combo_box() {
    let mut combo_box = ComboBox::new("example");

    combo_box.add_item(&"Option 1".to_string(), 1);
    combo_box.add_item(&"Option 2".to_string(), 2);
    combo_box.set_editable_text(true);
}
```
