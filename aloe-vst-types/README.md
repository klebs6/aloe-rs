# Aloe VST Types

Aloe VST Types is a Rust crate providing type definitions and trait implementations for building and interacting with VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins. This crate abstractly models Steinberg’s VST SDK interfaces and associated data types to facilitate operations such as interface querying, dependency management, and prefetchable support for audio processing plugins.

## Features

- Defines various VST-compatible enums, structs, and type aliases to represent plugin elements and configurations.
- Mimics Steinberg's COM-like interface management with reference counting and interface querying.
- Provides trait implementations that reflect audio plugin capabilities like `IPrefetchableSupport`, `IUpdateHandler`, and cloning via `ICloneable`.
- Includes macro definitions for standardized operations and interface definitions.
- Supports both plugin implementations and host interactions, covering a wide range of functionality from dependency handling to UID generation and management.

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` to include Aloe VST Types in your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-vst-types = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Import the crate into your Rust project:

```rust
extern crate aloe_vst_types;
use aloe_vst_types::*;
```

This gives access to all the provided traits, types, and macros to aid in the development of VST plugins. The crate implements typical operations for audio plugin development and supports the integration with Steinberg's VST SDK.
