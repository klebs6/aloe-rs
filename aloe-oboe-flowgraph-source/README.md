# Aloe Oboe Flowgraph Source

Aloe Oboe Flowgraph Source is a Rust crate designed for advanced audio processing applications, providing a series of base and concrete class implementations for edge nodes within a flowgraph architecture. These nodes act as audio sources by reading blocks of predefined data, which can be encoded in various formats such as 16-bit, 24-bit packed integer, 32-bit integer, and float.

## Architectural Overview

This crate defines several structures modeling different data source types:

- **FlowGraphSourceBuffered**: Acts as a node with no upstream nodes. It reads data from an external buffer and serves as a common base for other sources.
- **FlowGraphSourceI16, FlowGraphSourceI24, FlowGraphSourceI32, FlowGraphSourceFloat**: Derived from `FlowGraphSourceBuffered`, these nodes read audio data encoded in their specified formats.

## Key Traits and Methods

### Struct: `FlowGraphSourceBuffered`
- **`new(channel_count: i32) -> Self`**: Initializes a buffered source node with a specified channel count.
- **`set_data(&mut self, data: *const c_void, num_frames: i32)`**: Defines the external data buffer and its size that this source will read from.

### Structs: `FlowGraphSourceI16`, `FlowgraphSourceI24`, `FlowgraphSourceI32`, `FlowgraphSourceFloat`
- **`get_name() -> &'static str`**: Returns the name of the source type.
- **`on_process(&mut self, num_frames: i32) -> i32`**: Processes a specified number of frames, returning the number of frames successfully processed.

## Use Cases
This crate can be instrumental in applications requiring precise audio data handling and manipulation, such as audio engineering tools, real-time sound processing software, or custom digital audio workstations.

## Installation and Usage
Add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-flowgraph-source = "0.1.0"
```
