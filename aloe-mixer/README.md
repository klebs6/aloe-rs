# Aloe Mixer

**Aloe Mixer** is a sophisticated Rust crate designed for audio engineering. It provides robust functionality for dry/wet audio signal mixing with varying latency compensation, implemented through a modular and efficient API.

## Features

- **DryWetMixingRule Enum**: A set of powerful mixing rules that determines the behavior of dry/wet audio signal aggregation. Supported rules include:
  - `linear`
  - `balanced`
  - `sin3dB`
  - `sin4p5dB`
  - `sin6dB`
  - `squareRoot3dB`
  - `squareRoot4p5dB`

- **MixerAudioSource**: A structure allowing dynamic addition and removal of audio sources during operation, maintaining smooth transitions. It ensures optimal resource management through careful preparation and release of resources.

- **DryWetMixer**: Facilitates precise dry/wet mixing, incorporating configurable latency and volumetric proportions. The flexibility in adjusting the mixing rules empowers users to tailor audio outputs finely.

## Usage:

Below is a basic example illustrating how to integrate `DryWetMixer` into your workflow.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mixing_rule = DryWetMixingRule::linear;
    let maximum_wet_latency = 512;
    let mut mixer = DryWetMixer::new(maximum_wet_latency);
    
    mixer.set_mixing_rule(mixing_rule);
    // Configure additional parameters as required...
}
```
