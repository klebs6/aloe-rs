# Aloe VST PlugView

Aloe VST PlugView is a Rust crate providing an interface implementation for VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins' graphical user interface (GUI) management. This crate offers a comprehensive suite of traits and structures facilitating VST plugins' view handling and interaction with the host environment.

## Features

- **Plugin View Management**: Implement `IPlugView` to manage plugin GUI representation, including attaching and detaching views, handling keyboard inputs, and resizing.
- **Host Interaction**: Utilize `IPlugFrame` to enable plugins to prompt host window resizing and other interactions.
- **Linux Run Loop Management**: `IRunLoop` allows handling of file descriptor events and timer registrations on Linux, where a global event loop is absent.
- **Parameter Lookup**: `IParameterFinder` facilitates parameter identification based on cursor position, crucial for supporting advanced UI controls.
- **Content Scaling**: `IPlugViewContentScaleSupport` helps adjust view dimensions based on host-provided scale factors, contributing to responsive design on diverse display setups.

## Technical Overview

Aloe VST PlugView interfaces with various VST GUI subsystems, extending from view size management to event handling and scaling adjustments. It encompasses sophisticated implementations that ensure seamless operation within VST plugin host environments, meeting the mandatory requirements of Steinberg's VST3 specifications.

### Usage

Implement necessary traits in your plugin's GUI code, and leverage provided structures like `CPluginView` and `ViewRect` for efficient GUI rendering and interaction.

### Important Considerations

- Size management within `IPlugView` ensures proper synchrony between host and plugin GUI dimensions.
- Direct platform UI interaction for key events should be bypassed in favor of host-mediated event transmission, adhering to `IPlugView` guidelines.
- Linux-specific operations are supported via the `IRunLoop` trait, providing essential utilities in the absence of a unified event loop.
