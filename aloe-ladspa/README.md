# Aloe-LADSPA

`aloe-ladspa` is a Rust crate providing comprehensive management and instantiation of LADSPA audio plugins on Unix-like systems. This crate primarily focuses on implementing a plugin format manager capable of loading, scanning, and operating LADSPA plugins in an audio processing environment, leveraging dynamic libraries via `libladspa`. It supports Linux and BSD platforms.

## Features

- **Plugin Format Management**: Offers structure and functionality to manage and recognize LADSPA plugins.
- **Dynamic Module Handling**: Loads and interacts with modules via dynamic library utilities.
- **Instance Creation and Lifecycle**: Provides methods for creating plugin instances, initializing audio parameters, and executing plugins.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Ensures proper resource allocation and deallocation with `Drop` traits and recursive searches.
- **Thread Safety**: Utilizes critical sections to ensure thread-safe operations during plugin interactions.

## Introduction to Core Components

The crate comprises several core constructs that define its functionality:

### `LADSPAPluginFormat`
- Manages plugin formats and scanning processes.
- Provides methods to determine a file's plugin validity and manage search directories.

### `LADSPAModuleHandle`
- Handles the loading and management of dynamic libraries, maintaining active module lists.
- Implements RAII for module opening and closing.

### `LADSPAPluginInstance`
- Represents individual plugin instances, dealing with initialization and execution.
- Manages audio buffers and ports, facilitating seamless audio processing.

## Usage
Add `aloe-ladspa` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-ladspa = "0.1"
```

Include the crate in your project:

```rust
use aloe_ladspa::{LADSPAPluginFormat, LADSPAModuleHandle, LADSPAPluginInstance};

// Example usage creating and initializing a LADSPA plugin instance
```
