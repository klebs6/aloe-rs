# Aloe Test

Aloe Test is a Rust crate designed to facilitate structured unit testing. It provides abstractions and interfaces for running, logging, and managing unit tests through a standardized approach. The crate is built on two main interfaces: `UnitTestInterface` and `UnitTestRunnerInterface`, which define the methodology for initializing, running, and shutting down unit tests, as well as capturing and responding to test results.

## Features

- **Unit Test Management**: Allows you to design and manage unit tests using `UnitTest` and `UnitTestRunner` structures.
- **Logging and Result Handling**: Provides comprehensive logging features for both successful and failed tests, which can be tailored to assert on failures and log test passes.
- **Category-Based Test Execution**: Run all or specific categories of tests easily, using deterministic or random seeds.
- **Interception and Custom Behavior**: Implement custom behavior using subclasses of `UnitTestRunner` to handle logging and results effectively.

## Getting Started

Include `aloe-test` in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-test = "0.1.0"
```

## Basic Usage

Create a unit test by subclassing `UnitTest`:

```rust
struct MyTest;

impl UnitTestInterface for MyTest {
    fn initialise(&mut self) {}

    fn shutdown(&mut self) {}

    fn run_test(&mut self) {
        self.begin_test("Example Test");
        self.expect(true, Some("Expected success"));
    }
}
```

Use `UnitTestRunner` to execute your tests:

```rust
let mut runner = UnitTestRunner::new();
runner.run_all_tests(None);
```

## Advanced Features

- Comprehensive result analysis allowing detailed inspection of execution passes and failures.
- Randomization control through seed management for reproducible test scenarios.
