# aloe-oversampling

`aloe-oversampling` is a robust Rust crate purpose-built to handle complex digital signal processing (DSP) tasks with emphasis on oversampling methods. This library provides versatile features for conducting high-performance, multi-channel oversampling operations, leveraging FIR or IIR filters to suit latency and phase distortion requirements. At its core, `aloe-oversampling` was developed to mitigate aliasing in nonlinear processes by increasing the sample rate of input signals through oversampling stages configured for 2, 4, 8, or 16x scales. 

The crate is engineered to offer flexibility, allowing engineers to select between FIR (achieving linear phase but higher latency) or IIR filtering (offering minimum phase at the expense of some phase compromise around the Nyquist frequency, but minimizing latency). 

## Features

- **Multiple Filter Types**: Choose between `HalfBandFIREquiripple` and `HalfBandPolyphaseIIR`. 
- **Configurable Oversampling Factors**: Up to 16 times sample rate enhancement.
- **Latency Compensation**: Adjust processing to maintain integer latency.
- **Advanced Filter Design Methodologies**: Incorporate state-of-the-art Equiripple and Polyphase Allpass designs for sophisticated audio manipulation.

## Usage

To integrate `aloe-oversampling` into your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oversampling = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use aloe_oversampling::{Oversampling, OversamplingFilterType};

let mut oversampler = Oversampling::new(
    2, 
    4, 
    OversamplingFilterType::filterHalfBandPolyphaseIIR, 
    Some(true), 
    Some(false)
);

// Initialize processing
oversampler.init_processing(1024);

// Now you can process audio samples through the oversampler
```
