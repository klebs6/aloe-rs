# Aloe LookAndFeel Crate

The `aloe-lookandfeel` crate provides an extensive framework for customizing the graphical user interface (GUI) look-and-feel, tailored to the Aloe GUI toolkit. It defines numerous color IDs and LookAndFeel methods to support a wide range of GUI components such as buttons, windows, sliders, and more.

## Overview

The crate includes enums and traits for color identification and customization across different components, enabling both static and dynamic appearance changes. Key elements include:

- **Color Enums**: Define color IDs for various components like `SidePanel`, `ComboBox`, `DocumentWindow`, etc.
- **LookAndFeel Traits**: Abstract base classes designed to be implemented by sub-classes providing specialized drawing and customization capabilities (e.g., `SidePanelLookAndFeelMethods`, `ComboBoxLookAndFeelMethods`).
- **LookAndFeel Versions**: Define classes and methods for existing styles (e.g., `LookAndFeel_V1`, `LookAndFeel_V2`, `LookAndFeel_V3`, `LookAndFeel_V4`) with customization options (e.g., color schemes).

## Usage

Implement and customize these look-and-feel traits in your application to adapt the appearance of GUI elements according to your design goals. You can easily set colors and adjust styles dynamically through provided enums and methods:

```rust
let scheme = LookAndFeelV4ColourScheme::new(
    [Colour::from_rgb(0x32, 0x3e, 0x44), ...]
);
let mut look_and_feel_v4 = LookAndFeel_V4::new(scheme);
look_and_feel_v4.set_colour_scheme(scheme);
```

## Traits and Methods

- **LookAndFeel**: Base trait marking classes that define skins of UI components.
- **SidePanelLookAndFeelMethods**: Methods for modifying appearance of side panels.
- **ComboBoxLookAndFeelMethods**: Covers drawing and font settings for combo box items.
- **Resize Methods**: Adjust component sizes dynamically for scalable applications.
