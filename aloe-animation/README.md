# Aloe Animation

Aloe Animation is a Rust crate designed for implementing advanced animation behaviors with customizable physics and dynamics, focusing on efficiency and precision for GUI applications.

### Overview
The crate provides a suite of traits and structures to facilitate custom animation behaviors. It employs sophisticated mathematical computations and physics-based models for creating smooth and efficient animations, particularly useful in graphical user interfaces. The core modules include behaviors that simulate both non-snapping and snapping dynamics, offering flexibility in animation control and component manipulation.

### Key Components
- **`AnimatedPositionBehavior`**: A trait establishing contracts for position-based animation dynamics.
- **`AnimationBehaviorIsStopped`, `AnimationBehaviorGetNextPosition`**: Essential traits to determine motion states and predict position changes over time.
- **`ComponentAnimator`**: Manages complex animations involving component movements and alpha transitions, ensuring responsiveness and minimizing graphical latency.
- **`AnimatedPosition`**: Models positions with inertia, allowing for drag-and-release interactions while maintaining a fluid user experience.

### Usage
```rust
use aloe_animation::{AnimatedPosition, SnapToPageBoundaries, ComponentAnimator};

// Define an animation with snapping behavior
let mut snap_behavior = SnapToPageBoundaries::default();
let mut animated_position = AnimatedPosition::default();
animated_position.set_limits(0.0..100.0);
animated_position.begin_drag();
animated_position.drag(50.0);
animated_position.end_drag();

// Animator for controlling component transitions
let mut animator = ComponentAnimator::default();
animator.animate_component(&mut component, &final_position, 1.0, 500, true, 0.5, 0.5);
```

### Advanced Features
- **Customizable Animation Trajectories**: Implement and define unique animation paths using physics-driven behaviors.
- **Dynamic Listener Callbacks**: Engage with changes in animation states through listener interfaces, allowing for responsive updates in complex systems.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Includes memory-safety and leak-detection mechanisms, ensuring performance integrity over prolonged usage.
