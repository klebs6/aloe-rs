# Aloe Events Crate

Aloe-events is a sophisticated Rust crate designed to facilitate interprocess communication and event management in complex applications. This crate is particularly useful in contexts where an application is built on a multi-platform event-driven architecture, such as GUI-based applications or those requiring robust inter-process messaging.

## Features

- **Interprocess Communication:** Aloe-events enables seamless communication between master and slave processes, allowing for the sending and receiving of messages through sockets or named pipes. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication paradigms, making it suitable for a variety of use cases.

- **Event Management:** The crate provides mechanisms to send and receive events, manage listeners, and broadcast changes. With traits like `ActionListener`, `ChangeListener`, and `InterprocessCommunicationInterface`, it ensures efficient event handling.

- **Timer Management:** Timer and MultiTimer classes enable repeated callbacks at specified intervals, providing timed operations that are crucial in a GUI context.

- **Application Lifecycle Management:** Interfaces such as `ALOEApplicationBaseInterface` and macros to start Aloe applications (`START_ALOE_APPLICATION`) are included, which simplify the setup and teardown of application processes.

## Usage

To use this crate, start by including it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-events = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use aloe_events::{ChildProcessMaster, ChildProcessSlave};

fn main() {
    let mut master = ChildProcessMaster::default();
    if master.launch_slave_process(&"./slave_executable", &"uniqueID", None, None) {
        master.send_message_to_slave(...); // communicate with the slave
    }
}
```

## Crate Structure

- **Notification Types:** Enum `NotificationType` specifies the type of notification to send—either synchronous, asynchronous, or none.

- **Interprocess Communication Enums:** `InterprocessCommunicationNotify` determines whether to notify on disconnections.

- **Event Traits:** Implement user-defined logic for handling events by implementing provided traits such as `ActionListener` and `MessageListenerInterface`.

- **Built-in Macros:** Macros for application management enable cross-platform compatibility with specific adaptations for Windows and iOS.

## Technical Considerations

The crate is designed with high performance and low-overhead communication in mind, leveraging Rust's safe concurrency model to prevent race conditions and ensure reliable message delivery.
