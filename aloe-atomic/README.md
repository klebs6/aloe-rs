# Aloe Atomic

Aloe Atomic is a Rust crate that offers a streamlined and robust wrapper around the standard `std::atomic` module. It facilitates operations on atomic data with an emphasis on convenience and performance.

## Key Features

- **Type Parametrization**: The `Atomic` struct is generic, designed to support various types.
- **Thread-Safety**: Implements atomic operations ensuring thread safety without manual synchronization.
- **Enhanced Arithmetic**: Provides `AddAssign` and `SubAssign` implementations for atomic arithmetic.
- **Atomic Operations**: Includes atomic functions for setting, exchanging, comparing, and incrementing/decrementing values.
- **Memory Barriers**: Implements memory read/write barriers to ensure memory order consistency using `std::atomic_thread_fence`.
- **Lock-Free Safety**: Safeguards user operations with assurances related to lock-free atomic types, aligning with C++ atomic capabilities.

## Usage

To use Aloe Atomic in your project, include it in your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-atomic = "0.1.0"
```

## Example

```rust
use aloe_atomic::Atomic;

fn main() {
    let mut atomic_value = Atomic::new_from_initial_value(10);
    atomic_value.add_assign(5);
    assert_eq!(atomic_value.get(), 15);
}
```
