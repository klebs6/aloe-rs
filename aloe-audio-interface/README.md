# Aloe Audio Interface

Aloe Audio Interface is a Rust crate designed for the intricate task of interfacing with audio processing plugins. It abstracts a myriad of audio processing interfaces and tools necessary for managing both audio and MIDI data. This crate is especially useful for developing audio applications that require precise control over the audio processing pipeline.

## Key Features
- **Robust Audio Processing Interfaces**: Wraps a wide spectrum of audio processing components like `AudioProcessor`, `AudioChannelSet`, and `AudioPluginInstanceInterface`.
- **Comprehensive MIDI Support**: Handles various MIDI operations including message construction, MIDI event processing, and MIDI machine control commands.
- **Flexible Audio Graph Integration**: Allows for the construction and manipulation of audio processing graphs, facilitating complex audio routing and processing scenarios.
- **Precision Control**: Engineered with precision in mind, supporting both single and double precision floating-point processing for advanced audio computations.

## Getting Started
To start using Aloe Audio Interface, add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-interface = "0.1.0"
```

## Examples

### Building an Audio Processor
```rust
use aloe_audio_interface::AudioProcessorInterface;

struct MyAudioProcessor;

impl AudioProcessorInterface for MyAudioProcessor {
    // Implement required methods here.
}
```

### Handling MIDI Events
```rust
use aloe_audio_interface::{MidiMessageInterface, IsTrackMetaEvent};

struct MidiEvent;

impl IsTrackMetaEvent for MidiEvent {
    fn is_track_meta_event(&self) -> bool {
        // Implementation here.
    }
}
```

## Traits Overview
- `AudioProcessorInterface`: Core interface for audio processors.
- `MidiMessageInterface`: Central to MIDI message handling.
- `AudioChannelSetInterface`: Abstracts audio channel configurations.
