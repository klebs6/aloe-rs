# Aloe Playhead Crate

Aloe Playhead is a Rust crate designed to provide an interface for tracking and controlling the position and status of a moving playhead within audio playback applications. This crate is particularly useful for developers working on audio processing tasks, allowing them to gain precise control and feedback over the audio rendering process. 

## Features

- **Frame Rate Management**: Define and handle various frame rates such as 23.976 fps, 24 fps, 25 fps, and more through the `FrameRateType` enum.
- **Audio Playhead Interface**: Implement the `AudioPlayHeadInterface` trait to manage playhead positions, transport controls, and playback states.
- **Position Information Struct**: `AudioPlayHeadCurrentPositionInfo` struct stores detailed information about playback such as BPM, time signature, playback position, frame rate, and loop settings.

## Usage

To utilize the Aloe Playhead crate, integrate it within your audio processing module by implementing the `AudioPlayHeadInterface`. Use the provided functions to retrieve or reset the position data as necessary.

### Sample Code:

```rust
use aloe_playhead::{AudioPlayHeadInterface, AudioPlayHeadCurrentPositionInfo, FrameRateType};

struct MyAudioPlayHead {
    // Custom playhead data implementation
}

impl AudioPlayHeadInterface for MyAudioPlayHead {
    fn get_current_position(&mut self, result: &mut AudioPlayHeadCurrentPositionInfo) -> bool {
        // Logic to update result with current position
        true
    }

    fn can_control_transport(&mut self) -> bool {
        // Logic to determine if transport can be controlled
        true
    }

    fn transport_play(&mut self, should_start_playing: bool) {
        // Logic to handle playback control
    }

    fn transport_record(&mut self, should_start_recording: bool) {
        // Logic to toggle recording state
    }

    fn transport_rewind(&mut self) {
        // Logic to rewind the transport
    }
}
```

## Limitations

- This implementation does not contain a complete equality check logic for `AudioPlayHeadCurrentPositionInfo`. Users are encouraged to implement the `TODO` sections per their application's specificity.
