# Aloe Dynamic Object

`aloe-dynamic-object` is a Rust crate providing a robust infrastructure for dynamic object management, specifically designed for integrating scriptable objects within a Rust ecosystem. This crate is crafted to facilitate interaction with objects whose properties and methods are determined at runtime, typically aligning with the needs of scripting languages.

## Overview

The core functionality of this crate revolves around managing properties and methods of dynamic objects. The `DynamicObject` struct is the central entity, encapsulating properties in a `NamedValueSet` and providing mechanisms to manipulate these properties and methods.

### Features

- **Dynamic Properties**: Add, remove, get, and set named properties dynamically.
- **Method Handling**: Integrate and manage methods with customizable invocation processes.
- **JSON Serialization**: Convert dynamic objects into JSON format with flexible formatting options.
- **Cloning Capability**: Clone properties and methods of dynamic objects efficiently.

## Usage

To use `aloe-dynamic-object`, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-dynamic-object = "0.1.0"
```

Here's a brief example illustrating how to manipulate a `DynamicObject`:

```rust
use aloe_dynamic_object::{DynamicObject, DynamicObjectPtr, Var, Identifier};

fn main() {
    // Creating a dynamic object
    let mut obj = DynamicObject::default();

    // Defining property identifiers
    let property_name = Identifier::from("exampleProperty");
    let value = Var::from(100);

    // Setting a property
    obj.set_property(&property_name, &value);

    // Checking if the property exists
    if obj.has_property(&property_name) {
        // Accessing property value
        let prop_val = obj.get_property(&property_name);
    }

    // Removing a property
    obj.remove_property(&property_name);
}
```
