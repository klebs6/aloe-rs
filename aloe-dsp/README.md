# Aloe DSP

Aloe DSP is a sophisticated library for digital signal processing (DSP) applications in Rust. It provides a comprehensive set of interfaces and structures for audio processing, designed to leverage traits and structures in a modular, extensible manner. The components cover everything from parameter management to audio file handling and signal transformation.

## Features
- **Processor Abstractions**: Implementations and traits such as `ProcessorBase` allow for polymorphic audio processing.
- **Parameter Interfaces**: Handy base classes like `DSPDemoParameterBase` and abstractions for audio controls including `SliderParameter` and `ChoiceParameter`.
- **Audio Management**: `AudioFileReaderComponent` and `AudioPlayerHeader` simplify audio file handling with capabilities like async file operations and transport control.
- **Signal Processing Utilities**: Utility functions such as `decibels_to_gain` and `snap_to_zero` offer precise control in DSP contexts.
- **Processing Contexts**: Use contexts like `ProcessContextNonReplacing` and `ProcessContextReplacing` to manage input/output processing blocks efficiently.

## Getting Started
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-dsp = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
A typical usage example would involve setting up audio processing chains using the provided trait implementations and structures. Consider an audio file being processed with a custom filter encapsulated in a `ProcessorWrapper`.

```rust
// Example setup for setting up processing chain
let spec = ProcessSpec::default();
let mut processor = ProcessorWrapper::new(CustomProcessor::new());
processor.prepare(&spec);

let mut context = ProcessContextReplacing::new(audio_block_mut);
processor.process(&context);
```
