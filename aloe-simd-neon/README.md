# aloe-simd-neon

A Rust crate to facilitate efficient SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) computations using NEON intrinsics, targeting ARM architectures predominantly. This project emulates NEON operations in Rust, supporting types including both floating-point and integer operations with varying bit-widths.

## Features

- Comprehensive NEON intrinsic emulation including signed and unsigned integers (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit) and floating-point (single and double-precision) vectors.
- Optimized Digital Signal Processing (DSP) operations for high-performance calculations.
- Element-wise operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and bitwise manipulation.
- Functions for expanding scalars, vector load and store, lane-specific data manipulation, and complex arithmetic operations.

## Usage

To use this crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-simd-neon = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use aloe_simd_neon::SimdNeonI32;

let vector_a = SimdNeonI32::expand(5);
let vector_b = SimdNeonI32::expand(10);
let sum = SimdNeonI32::add(vector_a, vector_b);
println!("Sum: {:?}", sum);
```

For more intricate NEON operations, explore the API providing comprehensive bitwise operations, conditional comparisons, arithmetic operations suitable for high-performance applications in gaming, multimedia processing, and real-time computations.
