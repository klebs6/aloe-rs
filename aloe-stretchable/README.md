# aloe-stretchable

`aloe-stretchable` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate the layout management of UI components with dynamic sizing requirements. It offers robust mechanisms to manage components with specified size limits and preferred sizes, allowing them to dynamically adjust and fill available space efficiently. This crate is particularly useful in complex GUI applications where nested panels and component resizing are required.

## Features

- **Flexible Layout Management**: Create layouts that adapt to changing dimensions, allowing UI components to resize smoothly and proportionally.
- **One-dimensional Control**: Handle resizing in either vertical or horizontal dimensions effectively.
- **Resizer Bars**: Integrate `StretchableLayoutResizerBar` for intuitive drag-and-drop resizing of components.
- **Algorithmic Item Resizing**: Use `StretchableObjectResizer` to fit multiple resizable objects within constrained spaces using a sophisticated algorithm.
- **Utility Components**: Manage component dimensions through direct API calls to adjust sizes based on layout preferences.

## Usage Example
```rust
use aloe_stretchable::{StretchableLayoutManager, StretchableLayoutResizerBar};

fn setup_layout() {
    let mut layout_manager = StretchableLayoutManager::default();

    layout_manager.set_item_layout(0, 50.0, 100.0, -0.6); // item 0
    layout_manager.set_item_layout(1, -0.2, -0.6, 50.0); // item 1

    // Use a resizer bar to enable dynamic resizing by user interaction
    let resizer_bar = StretchableLayoutResizerBar::new(&mut layout_manager, 0, true);
}
```

## Components

- **`StretchableLayoutManager`**: Manages UI components' layout by maintaining their size limits and adjusting their positions.
- **`StretchableObjectResizer`**: Resizes objects within a given space to maintain harmony between components.
- **`StretchableLayoutResizerBar`**: Allows for user interaction to resize components using draggable bars.
