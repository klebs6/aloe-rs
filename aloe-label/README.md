# aloe-label

The `aloe-label` Rust crate facilitates the management and manipulation of textual labels within graphical user interfaces. It offers a framework for handling label editing through a comprehensive trait interface.

## Overview

At its core, `aloe-label` provides structures and interfaces that support adding event listeners to labels, handling text editor components, and managing keyboard focus traversal and accessibility. The crate supports real-time text editing and customizable event notification mechanisms when the label's text undergoes modifications.

## Key Components

- **Label**: Central to the crate, the `Label` struct acts as a component to display or edit a textual string. It can transform into an editable text field with configurable click interactions and focus behaviors.

- **LabelListener Trait**: Offers a method interface for responding to changes in label text, editor visibility, and text editing events.

- **LabelKeyboardFocusTraverser and LabelAccessibilityHandler**: Ensure optimal navigation and accessibility support within GUI environments, allowing focus management and state queries.

- **TextEditor Integration**: Through the `CreateEditorComponent` trait, labels can interface with `TextEditor` elements to enable user text input.

## Usage

To integrate `aloe-label` in your project:

1. Add `aloe-label` to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies.

2. Implement the `LabelListener` trait to handle event callbacks related to text changes.

3. Instantiate a `Label` with specified text and configure its attributes for click-to-edit behaviors and focus management.

Example:

```rust
use aloe_label::{Label, LabelListener};

struct MyLabelListener;
impl LabelListener for MyLabelListener {
    fn label_text_changed(&mut self, _: *mut Label) {
        // Handle text change
    }
    fn editor_shown(&mut self, _: *mut Label, _: &mut TextEditor) {}
    fn editor_hidden(&mut self, _: *mut Label, _: &mut TextEditor) {}
}

fn main() {
    let mut label = Label::new(&"Greeting".to_string(), &"Hello, World!".to_string());
    label.set_editable(true, Some(false), Some(false));
    // Further configuration and usage
}
```
