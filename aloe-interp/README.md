# Aloe-Interp

Aloe-Interp is an advanced Rust library designed for the precise resampling and interpolation of streams of floating-point numbers. It is highly suitable for audio processing applications, where maintaining signal integrity during resampling is critical.

The library offers multiple interpolation techniques:
- **Windowed Sinc Interpolation** - Ideal for high-fidelity applications where aliasing must be minimized.
- **Lagrange Interpolation** - Provides a polynomial-based approach suitable for smooth transitions.
- **Catmull-Rom Interpolation** - Ensures smooth, curve-based interpolation of data points.
- **Linear Interpolation** - A straightforward method for quick, computationally efficient resampling.
- **Zero Order Hold Interpolation** - Retains each sample value until the next is provided, ideal for certain discrete signals.

## Features
- **Stateful Design**: Each interpolation object preserves its state, accommodating continuous data streams.
- **Versatile Processing**: Handles multichannel audio by allowing separate interpolator instances per channel.
- **Reset capability**: Reset interpolators seamlessly in case of stream discontinuity using the `reset()` method.
- **Performance Tuning**: Trade-offs between computational complexity and resampling quality, suitable for both real-time and offline processing.

## Usage Notes
- Always ensure the continuity of input data streams. Initiate `reset()` during breaks.
- Each audio channel should independently utilize its own interpolator instance to maintain data integrity.

## Installation
Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:
```
aloe-interp = "0.1.0"
