# Aloe Filter Crate

Aloe Filter is a comprehensive Rust library designed for audio signal processing by implementing a variety of digital filters. Audio engineers and digital signal processing (DSP) specialists will find this crate particularly useful for its high precision and performance.

## Overview

The crate includes implementations of different filter types, including:

- **Linkwitz-Riley Filters**: Used extensively in audio crossovers, these provide precise control over multi-band separation with minimal phase distortion. Offers lowpass, highpass, and allpass filters with a fixed -24 dB/octave slope.
  
- **Ladder Filters**: Inspired by the Moog ladder filter, supporting multiple modes such as low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass with 12 and 24 dB/octave slopes.

- **State Variable Filters**: Versatile filters that provide low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filtering utilizing the topology-preserving transform (TPT) method, allowing fast modulation without introducing audio artifacts.

- **Ballistics Filter**: Useful for dynamics processing, implementing attack/release characteristics commonly employed in envelope followers and compressors.

## Features

- Extensive support for filter coefficient calculation using FIR and IIR methods.
- Thread-safe IIR filter processing classes with internal locking mechanisms.
- Real-time capable processing functions designed to minimize denormalized number issues.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-filter = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

A simple example demonstrating a Linkwitz-Riley filter application:

```rust
use aloe_filter::LinkwitzRileyFilter;

let mut filter = LinkwitzRileyFilter::default();
filter.set_cutoff_frequency(1000.0);
filter.set_type(LinkwitzRileyFilterType::lowpass);
// Process audio buffer here
```
