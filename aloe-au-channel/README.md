# aloe-au-channel

A high-efficiency Rust crate designed for audio channel management and manipulation, specifically within the context of AudioUnits (AU). This crate provides tools for handling audio channel layouts and bus configurations, which are critical in professional audio processing.

## Features
- **Audio Channel Layout**: Define and manage sophisticated audio channel layouts using structures like `CAAudioChannelLayout`.
- **Bus Configuration**: Seamlessly configure audio processor buses to meet specific audio routing requirements.
- **Channel Remapping**: Utilize `ChannelRemapper` to adjust channel layouts efficiently.
- **Reference Counting**: Employ `RefCountedLayout` to implement automatic memory management through reference counting.
- **Layout Compatibility**: Verify support for specific layouts through the `is_layout_supported` function.

### Core Structures

- **`CAAudioChannelLayout`**: A core component for depicting audio channel configurations, enabling the calculation of layout byte sizes and direct conversion into standard `AudioChannelLayout`.

- **`ChannelRemapper`**: Facilitates channel remapping by offering functions to allocate and manage channel maps for input and output buses.

- **`RefCountedLayout`**: Provides mechanisms for alignment and memory management of audio channel layouts using reference counting.

### Key Functions

- `is_layout_supported`: Evaluates if a given channel layout is supported by verifying its attributes against an audio processor's configurations.

- `get_au_channel_info`: Provides information on AU channel configurations, essential for gaining insights into potential input/output setups.

- `count_ones`: Efficiently counts the number of one bits in a word, leveraging a specialized algorithm for binary operations.

### Usage Example

```rust
fn main() {
    // Create and manage a simple audio channel layout
    let layout = CAAudioChannelLayout::new(2, true);
    if layout.is_valid() {
        println!("Audio channel layout is valid.");
    }
}
```
