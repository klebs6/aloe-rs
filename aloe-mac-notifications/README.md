# Aloe Mac Notifications

`aloe-mac-notifications` is a robust Rust library designed for seamless integration of push notifications on macOS platforms. Leveraging Apple's native notification features, it allows developers to manage notifications with precision and efficiency.

## Features

- **Registration**: Supports device registration for remote notifications, properly handling successes and failures.
- **Local Notifications**: Enables sending and managing local notifications with customizable attributes such as sounds, actions, and delivery times.
- **Notification Handling**: Implements comprehensive interfaces for delivering and interacting with both remote and local notifications.
- **Notification Conversion**: Facilitates conversion between Aloe notifications and macOS's `NSUserNotification` objects for compatibility and extensibility.

## Example Usage

To use the `aloe-mac-notifications` crate in your Rust project:

```rust
use aloe_mac_notifications::{PushNotificationsDelegateInterface, PushNotificationImpl};

// Initialize and setup notifications
let mut notifications = PushNotificationImpl::new(&mut push_notifications);
notifications.request_permissions_with_settings(&settings);

// Send a local notification
notifications.send_local_notification(&push_notification);
```

## Concepts and Background

In macOS, notifications are crucial for delivering timely information to users. This crate abstractly handles notifications by interacting with Objective-C classes using `NSUserNotification`, while managing notification settings and lifecycle.

## Installation

Include this crate in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-mac-notifications = "0.1.0"
```

## Important Notes

- This crate depends on macOS notifications, hence it is only suitable for macOS applications.
- Ensure proper testing on various macOS versions, as behavior may vary.
