# Aloe VST Host

Aloe VST Host is a Rust library designed to facilitate communication between VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins and their respective hosts. It provides a range of wrapper interfaces enabling seamless integration of VST3 plugins with legacy VST2 and various digital audio workstation (DAW) environments such as AAX and AU. Through its comprehensive trait implementations, it allows developers to manage and process MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) data, as well as handle host callbacks and attributes efficiently.

## Features
- **Interoperability:** Supports transforming VST3 plugins to be compatible with VST2, AAX, and AU hosts.
- **MPE Support:** Implements VST3WrapperMPESupport for proficient MPE to note expression translation.
- **Host Attribute Management:** Utilizes the `HostAttribute` enum for handling various types of host attributes, including integers, floats, strings, and binary data.
- **Dynamic Plug Interface:** Provides dynamic trait support for various plug interfaces ensuring broad compatibility across different host systems.

## Installation
Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-vst-host = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
Import the crate and leverage the implemented traits like `IVst3ToVst2Wrapper`, `IVst3ToAAXWrapper`, and others for creating a robust VST hosting application.

```rust
use aloe_vst_host::{IHostApplication, IVst3ToVst2Wrapper};

struct MyHostApplication;

impl IHostApplication for MyHostApplication {
    fn get_name(&mut self, name: String128) -> tresult {
        // Implementation here
    }
    fn create_instance(&mut self, cid: TUID, iid: TUID, obj: *mut *mut c_void) -> tresult {
        // Implementation here
    }
}

let my_host = MyHostApplication;
```
