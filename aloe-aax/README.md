# aloe-aax

`aloe-aax` is a Rust crate designed for precise control over modifier key interactions in applications. It provides interfaces to dynamically manage and retrieve modifier key states, facilitating integration into complex systems that require fine-grained input handling. This is especially useful in environments needing robust modifier key abstraction, such as GUI applications and cross-platform interface layers.

## Features

- **ModifierKeyProvider Trait**: Implement this trait to allow retrieval of Win32 modifier keys. This is essential for systems that need to interpret or manipulate modifier keys within the Win32 API context.

- **ModifierKeyReceiver Trait**: Utilize this interface to set or remove a provider for modifier key states, thus enabling modulable and dynamic input management.

## Usage

Implement the `ModifierKeyProvider` trait to provide a custom logic for Win32 modifier state retrieval:

```rust
pub struct MyModifierKeyProvider;

impl ModifierKeyProvider for MyModifierKeyProvider {
    fn get_win_32modifiers(&self) -> i32 {
        // Return a representation of the current modifier keys
        0 // Replace with actual logic
    }
}
```

Use the `ModifierKeyReceiver` trait to manage the modifier key provider:

```rust
pub struct MyKeyReceiver {
    provider: Option<*mut dyn ModifierKeyProvider>,
}

impl ModifierKeyReceiver for MyKeyReceiver {
    fn set_modifier_key_provider(&mut self, provider: *mut dyn ModifierKeyProvider) {
        self.provider = Some(provider);
    }

    fn remove_modifier_key_provider(&mut self) {
        self.provider = None;
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

Add `aloe-aax` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-aax = "0.1.0"
```
