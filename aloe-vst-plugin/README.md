# Aloe VST Plugin

Aloe VST Plugin is a meticulously designed Rust crate tailored for the creation and management of audio plugin instances conforming to the VST3 standard. It serves as an essential tool for developers aiming to integrate or develop audio processing applications with efficient plugin architectures.

## Overview

The `aloe-vst-plugin` crate provides comprehensive definitions and interfaces necessary for developing extensible and robust audio plugins based on the VST3 specification.

### Core Components:

- **`IPluginBase`**: Core component interface initializing and terminating plugin components. Establishes necessary communication with the host application.
  
- **`IPluginFactory`**: Facilitates the creation of plugin instances and provides class information; a crucial component in plugin instance management and interaction.
  
- **`IPluginFactory3` & `IPluginFactory2`**: Extends functionality with support for unicode class information and enhanced class management.

- **`IPlugInterfaceSupport`**: Query mechanism to evaluate host-supported interfaces, ensuring seamless integration and compatibility checks.

## Getting Started

Implementers can extend the `IPluginFactory` trait to create unique plugin instances. The interface offers methods such as `create_instance`, `count_classes`, and `get_class_info` to manage plugin lifecycle and metadata.

### Example Usage:

```rust
fn initialize_plugin() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    let factory: *mut dyn IPluginFactory = get_plugin_factory();
    if factory.is_null() {
        return Err("Failed to initialize plugin factory.");
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
