# Aloe Math Expression

Aloe Math Expression is a Rust crate designed to provide a robust mechanism for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions. Specifically crafted for numerical and symbolic computations, it supports a range of arithmetic operations, named symbols, and function calls within expressions. The library facilitates complex expression manipulations and evaluations with the support for custom symbol resolution and function execution through the `ExpressionScopeInterface`.

## Features

- **Expression Parsing**: Constructs expressions from C-style strings, interpreting numeric constants, symbols, and functions.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Dynamically evaluate expressions with support for basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), common functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `min`, `max`), and custom symbol resolution.
- **Symbol and Scope Management**: Ability to rename symbols, and determine symbol dependencies within an expression context.
- **Advanced Operations**: Arithmetic operations, function creation, and inverse expression evaluation to achieve target results.

## Getting Started

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file to start using the crate:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-math-expression = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_math_expression::{Expression, ExpressionScopeInterface};

fn main() {
    let mut err = String::new();
    let expr = Expression::new("3 + sin(x)", &mut err);
    if err.is_empty() {
        println!("Parsed expression: {}", expr.to_string());
    } else {
        println!("Error occurred: {}", err);
    }
}
```
