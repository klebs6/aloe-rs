# Aloe System Crate

Aloe System is a sophisticated Rust crate designed to interface with underlying system configurations and properties. It provides a comprehensive abstraction for querying and interacting with varied operating systems to determine system-level details and capabilities, both hardware and software. 

## Features

- Identifies and enumerates various operating systems, providing detailed versioning information for MacOSX and Windows.
- Engages with system crash handlers and establishes crash handler callbacks through platform-specific data interfaces.
- Capable of retrieving elaborate CPU information, including instruction sets (e.g. SSE, AVX) and logical/physical CPU counts.
- Functions to read environment variables, device descriptions, user locale, and system hardware specifications.
- Supports WASM and provides specific functionalities for web assembly environments.

## Usage

Add to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-system = "0.1.0"
```

## Example

```rust
use aloe_system::SystemStats;

fn main() {
    let os_type = SystemStats::get_operating_system_type();
    println!("Operating System Type: {:?}", os_type);
}
```

This is a powerful crate designed for developers seeking efficient and detailed interfacing with system attributes, making it vital in environments where system awareness is crucial.
