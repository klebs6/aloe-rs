# Aloe X11 Rust Crate

## Overview
The `aloe-x11` crate is a sophisticated Rust library designed for interfacing with the X11 windowing system. It facilitates interaction with window properties, mouse and keyboard events, and graphical rendering using X11 APIs. Through its support for handling drag and drop operations, clipboard management, and display settings, this crate serves as an essential toolkit for developing GUI applications on X11-based systems.

## Features and Functionality
- **Window Management**: Create, manage, and destroy X11 windows efficiently. Provides control over window visibility, size, position, and decorations.
- **Input Management**: Handle keyboard and mouse events, including motion, clicks, and key presses/releases. Supports sophisticated input scenarios with extended key codes and modifier management.
- **Drag and Drop Support**: Implements X11 Drag and Drop (XDND) protocol, making it possible to handle drag and drop events seamlessly within your applications.
- **Clipboard Operations**: Advanced clipboard access and management, supporting text data and interactions with the X11 clipboard selection model.
- **Visuals and Rendering**: Manage display visuals and depths. Capable of rendering images to windows using both direct and shared memory techniques.
- **Synchronization with X11**: Utilizes XLockDisplay and XUnlockDisplay mechanisms for RAII-style synchronization to ensure threadsafe operations with the X server.

## Concepts Utilized
A background in systems programming, particularly knowledge of the X11 system, is beneficial. Concepts such as atoms in X11, visual depth management, shared memory (XShm), and device buffering (XRender) are applied throughout the implementation.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-x11 = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
Example code for creating a window and handling basic mouse events:
```rust
use aloe_x11::{XWindowSystem, MouseButtons};

fn main() {
    let x11 = XWindowSystem::new();
    let window = x11.create_window(/* params */);

    // Handle mouse events
    x11.handle_button_press_event(|event| {
        match event.button {
            MouseButtons::LeftButton => println!("Left button pressed"),
            _ => println!("Other button pressed"),
        }
    });

    x11.destroy_window(window);
}
```

## Notes
Due to the interactions with low-level system components, it is crucial for users to ensure they have the necessary permissions and configurations to access X11 from Rust. This crate assumes familiarity with Rust's ownership and concurrency models to leverage its full capabilities effectively.
