# Aloe Desktop Crate

Aloe Desktop is a sophisticated Rust library designed to facilitate comprehensive management of desktop display environments. This crate enables precise control and manipulation of connected displays, benefitting GUI applications that require awareness of multi-display setups, display orientations, and complex rendering pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Display Management**: Enumerate and manage detailed information about each connected display, including resolution, scale, and safe areas.
- **Orientation Handling**: Handle multiple display orientations, catering to dynamic environments such as tablets and rotating monitors.
- **Kiosk Mode**: Seamlessly transition components to full-screen mode, hiding system UI elements like the taskbar or dock.
- **Focus and Input Management**: Register for and respond to global focus changes and mouse inputs across the entire desktop environment.
- **Physical and Logical Conversions**: Convert between physical and logical pixel dimensions, taking scaling factors into account, to maintain consistent rendering.

## Usage

To utilize Aloe Desktop in your own application, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-desktop = "0.1.0"
```

Leverage the crate's robust API to manage displays and input sources:

- **Find Displays**: Use `Displays::find_displays()` to populate and retrieve information about current display configurations.
- **Focus Listeners**: Implement the `FocusChangeListener` trait for components that need to respond to focus changes.
- **Input Sources**: Access and manage input sources through `Desktop::get_mouse_sources()` to handle multi-touch and mouse interactions.

## Example

```rust
use aloe_desktop::{Desktop, Displays};

fn main() {
    let mut desktop = Desktop::new();
    let displays = desktop.get_displays();

    println!("Number of displays: {}", displays.displays.len());
}
```
