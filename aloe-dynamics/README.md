# Aloe Dynamics

The `aloe-dynamics` crate provides a powerful suite of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) tools tailored for advanced audio processing tasks such as gating, compressing, limiting, and gain manipulation of audio signals. It is designed for developers and audio engineers who require precise control over audio parameters for professional sound engineering applications.

## Components

### 1. NoiseGate
- **Purpose**: Silences unwanted noise by attenuating signals below a set threshold. Functions as an expander with low ratios.
- **Key Features**: Adjustable threshold, ratio, attack time, and release time.

### 2. Bias
- **Purpose**: Adds a DC offset to audio samples, useful for asymmetric waveshaping.
- **Key Features**: Simple bias implementation with range control and smoothing ramp.

### 3. Gain
- **Purpose**: Applies gain to audio samples with support for smoothing.
- **Key Features**: Adjustable gain in linear and decibel values, ramp duration configurations.

### 4. Limiter
- **Purpose**: Prevents audio clipping by applying a threshold and release time control featuring two compressors and a hard clipper.
- **Key Features**: Dual-stage compression with a hard clipper at 0 dB.

### 5. Compressor
- **Purpose**: Reduces dynamic range by lowering loud sounds and amplifying quiet sounds.
- **Key Features**: Adjustable threshold, ratio, attack time, and release time.

## Usage
To employ any of these components, instantiate them with the desired `SampleType` and configure their parameters using the provided setters. Each component includes a `prepare` method to initialize processing and a `process` method to apply the DSP operations in a processing context.

## Example
```rust
use aloe_dynamics::{NoiseGate, Compressor};

let mut noise_gate = NoiseGate::default();
noise_gate.set_threshold(-30.0);
noise_gate.set_ratio(4.0);
noise_gate.set_attack(10.0);
noise_gate.set_release(50.0);

let mut compressor = Compressor::default();
compressor.set_threshold(-20.0);
compressor.set_ratio(3.0);
compressor.set_attack(5.0);
compressor.set_release(100.0);
```
