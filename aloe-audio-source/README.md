# Aloe Audio Source

Aloe Audio Source is a Rust crate offering a suite of advanced audio sources for handling and manipulating audio data. It provides configurable structures for streaming and processing audio with features like resampling, buffering, and channel remapping, suitable for high-performance applications with real-time audio processing requirements.

## Features

- **Positionable Audio Sources**: Manage audio streams with finite length and trackable read positions.
- **Buffering Audio Sources**: Asynchronous audio buffering, leveraging background threads for optimized playback.
- **Channel Remapping**: Flexible input-output channel mappings to suit diverse audio configurations.
- **Resampling**: Alter the sample rate of audio streams efficiently, supporting both upsampling and downsampling.
- **Memory Audio Sources**: Embed audio data directly, offering optional memory ownership and loop control.
- **Tone Generator**: Simple sine wave generation for testing and audio synthesis purposes.

## Technical Background

Aloe Audio Source employs a variety of Rust-specific techniques, including unsafe code blocks where performance and low-level control are pivotal. Concepts such as atomic operations, scoped pointers, and spinlocks ensure thread safety and efficiency during audio processing.

## Usage Example

```rust
use aloe_audio_source::BufferingAudioSource;
use aloe_audio_source::ToneGeneratorAudioSource;

demo_audio_processing_function();

// Setup a tone generator audio source
let mut tone_generator = ToneGeneratorAudioSource::default();
tone_generator.set_frequency(440.0);
tone_generator.set_amplitude(0.5);

// Example of using BufferingAudioSource
let mut thread = your_thread_initialization();
let mut buffering_audio_source = BufferingAudioSource::new(&tone_generator, &mut thread, true, 2048, Some(2), Some(true));

// Call processing functions
demo_audio_processing_function();

fn demo_audio_processing_function() {}
```

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
