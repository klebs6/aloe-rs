# Aloe Standalone

Aloe Standalone is a Rust crate designed to facilitate the implementation of standalone instances of audio plugins. By leveraging `AudioDeviceManager`, `AudioProcessorPlayer`, and other essential elements, it offers powerful audio processing capabilities without embedding within a host application.

## Features

- **Standalone Audio Processing**: Create and run audio plugins in a standalone fashion using the `createPluginFilter()` function.
- **Comprehensive MIDI and Audio Management**: Utilize `AudioDeviceManager` for handling audio and MIDI devices with efficiency.
- **State Management**: Save and restore the state of your audio processor seamlessly through user dialogs.
- **Platform Independent**: Supports Android, iOS, and desktop platforms with conditional configuration for MIDI device management.
- **Buffer Size Handling**: Ensures predictable buffer sizes for audio callbacks to prevent out-of-bounds issues across platforms.

## Core Concepts

- **StandalonePluginHolder**: Central object facilitating audio processing. Manages processor creation, device handling, plugin lifecycle, and user settings.
- **StandaloneFilterWindow**: Provides a windowing wrapper to host and manage the plugin interface, featuring options for user interactions.
- **CallbackMaxSizeEnforcer**: Addresses platform-specific buffer size discrepancies, ensuring stable audio and MIDI I/O operations.

## Quick Start

```rust
use aloe_standalone::StandalonePluginHolder;

fn main() {
    // Initialize and configure standalone audio processor instance
    let settings_to_use = std::ptr::null_mut();
    let preferred_setup_options = std::ptr::null();
    let holder = StandalonePluginHolder::new(
        settings_to_use,
        Some(true),
        Some("default"),
        preferred_setup_options,
        None,
        Some(true),
    );
    
    // Additional logic to utilize plugin holder
}
```
