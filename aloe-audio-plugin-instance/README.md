# Aloe Audio Plugin Instance Crate

The `aloe-audio-plugin-instance` crate provides foundational components for handling active instances of audio plugins. It extends the `AudioProcessor` paradigm, facilitating the integration and management of dynamically loaded plugins within a host environment. This package is dedicated to plugin hosting infrastructures and not intended for plugin development itself. 

## Features
- **AudioPluginInstance:** Flexible struct harnessing the powers of `AudioProcessor` for plugin hosting scenarios.
- **GetExtensions Trait:** Fetches specific details about plugin implementations such as VST and AudioUnit formats, allowing a deep dive into the plugin's internals via the `ExtensionsVisitorInterface`.
- **Comprehensive Parameter Handling:** Includes methods to manage and query plugin parameters, offering capabilities like name resolution, parameter ID retrieval, step counts, and attribute checks.

## Usage
Here is an example of how you can instantiate and work with the `AudioPluginInstance` in your Rust application:

```rust
use aloe_audio_plugin_instance::{AudioPluginInstance, AudioProcessorBusesProperties};

fn main() {
    let io_layouts = AudioProcessorBusesProperties::new();
    let plugin_instance = AudioPluginInstance::new_with_io_layouts(&io_layouts);
    // Further processing...
}
```

### API Elements

#### Structs:
- `AudioPluginInstance`: A struct derived from `AudioProcessor` with methods catering to plugin manipulation.
- `AudioPluginInstanceParameter`: Holds parameter information for plugins, supporting value to text conversion and vice-versa.

#### Implementations:
- Trait `GetExtensions`: Method `get_extensions()` enabling extraction of plugin-specific data.
