# Aloe VST Edit

Aloe VST Edit provides a Rust implementation of a VST 3.x plugin editor interface. It wraps and extends core interfaces to facilitate handling parameters, MIDI mappings, context menus, and host interactions.

## Key Features
- **Restart Component:** Implements `RestartFlags` to manage component restarts.
- **MIDI Mapping Interface:** Manages MIDI controllers to ensure proper host integration for automation and mapping.
- **Context Menu Integration:** Facilitates creating context menus, allowing plugins to interact seamlessly with the host environment.
- **Edit Controller Extensions:** Provides capabilities for managing parameter edits, group edits, and host notifications.
- **Bus Activation:** Requests activation or deactivation of specific audio buses within the host.

## Modules
- **Interfaces:** 
  - `IComponentHandler`, `IComponentHandler2`, `IComponentHandler3`: Manage host-plugin interactions.
  - `IProgress`: Helps in communicating progress for tasks from the plugin to the host.

- **Structs:** 
  - `EditController`: Contains the base component handler and extension features for handling plugin parameter operations.
  - `ProgramList`: Manages program lists and related operations, including pitch name handling.

## Usage
1. **Implement Interfaces:** Utilize provided traits to implement necessary functionality required by VST plugins.
2. **Handle MIDI and Parameter Changes:** Leverage interfaces like `IMidiMapping` and parameter control methods for seamless integration and parameter automation.
3. **Manage Context Menus:** Create and customize context menus using the `IContextMenu` trait in conjunction with host interfaces.

### Example Usage:
```rust
fn main() {
  // Assuming appropriate trait implementations and setup
  let mut edit_controller = EditController::new();
  // Customize and interact with VST components using available APIs
}
```
