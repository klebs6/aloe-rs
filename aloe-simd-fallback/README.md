# aloe-simd-fallback

`aloe-simd-fallback` is a Rust crate providing efficient SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations with a reliable fallback mechanism for situations where native SIMD support is absent. The crate enables accelerated vectorized computation by abstracting over potential SIMD instructions across various platforms, offering both performance and portability.

## Features
- **Unified SIMD Trait Interface**: Provides an abstraction over SIMD operations through the `SIMDOps` trait. This includes operations like addition, multiplication, comparison, and complex number multiplication using SIMD vectors.
- **Fallback Capabilities**: Implements fallback routines when native SIMD instructions are unavailable, ensuring consistent functionality.
- **Extensible Operations**: Supports customization and extension of operations through `ScalarOp`, `Op`, `OpMask`, and other traits.

## Key Structures
- `SIMDFallbackOps`: Holds operations that serve as fallbacks to SIMD instructions. Offers error handling through `SimdError` for out-of-bounds operations.
- `VSIMDUtility`: Facilitates SIMD vector arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and logical operations.

## Usage
Hereâ€™s how to leverage the crate for vector operations:

```rust
use aloe_simd_fallback::{SIMDOps, SIMDFallbackOps};

let a = ...; // Your SIMD vector
let b = ...; // Another SIMD vector

// Example to use add operation
let result = SIMDFallbackOps::add(a, b);

// Error handling for out-of-bounds access
match SIMDFallbackOps::get(a, 5) {
    Ok(value) => println!("Value: {value}"),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {e:?}"),
};
```

## Advanced Operations
- **Complex Multiplications**: Support for complex number multiplication with SIMD vectors, aiding in applications requiring complex arithmetic.
- **Compile-time Computations**: Provides `log2_helper` function for compile-time log base 2 calculations, useful in optimization scenarios.
