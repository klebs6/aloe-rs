# Aloe Unlocking

Aloe Unlocking is a sophisticated Rust library designed to facilitate intricate in-app purchasing and licensing functionalities for applications on various platforms. Specifically, it supports interactions with the Apple App Store, leveraging iOS-specific in-app purchase mechanisms while also offering features to manage online unlocking and software licensing across other platforms.

## Key Features

- **In-App Purchase Management**: Provides comprehensive tools to purchase products, restore purchases, and manage download transactions, specifically for iOS platforms.
- **Online Unlocking System**: A robust framework to handle application unlocking by interacting with online stores, extendable with store-specific customizations.
- **License and Key File Management**: Utilities for generating and verifying key files, with capabilities for generating expiring keys and handling licensing in a secure manner.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-unlocking = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage Example

To implement in-app purchasing, create an `InAppPurchases` instance, attach the necessary listeners, and perform purchasing operations:

```rust
let mut in_app_purchases = InAppPurchases::default();

if in_app_purchases.is_in_app_purchases_supported() {
    in_app_purchases.get_products_information(&StringArray::from(["product_1", "product_2"]));
}
```

For online unlocking, utilize the `OnlineUnlockStatus` for managing license status:

```rust
let mut unlock_status = OnlineUnlockStatus::new();
unlock_status.load();
if unlock_status.is_unlocked() {
    println!("Application is unlocked.");
}
```

## Architecture

The library defines various components such as enums, traits, and structs to integrate in-app purchase logic and online unlocking seamlessly. Notably, it includes:

- `InAppPurchasesDownloadStatus`: Enum to track download states.
- `InAppPurchasesDownload`: Trait defining in-app purchase download properties.
- `OnlineUnlockStatus`: Strategy for managing app unlocking status and initiating server communication for validation.
