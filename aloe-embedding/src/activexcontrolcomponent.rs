/**
  | A Windows-specific class that can create
  | and embed an ActiveX control inside
  | itself.
  | 
  | To use it, create one of these, put it
  | in place and make sure it's visible in
  | a window, then use createControl()
  | to instantiate an ActiveX control.
  | The control will then be moved and resized
  | to follow the movements of this component.
  | 
  | Of course, since the control is a heavyweight
  | window, it'll obliterate any
  | 
  | Aloe components that may overlap this
  | component, but that's life.
