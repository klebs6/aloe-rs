# aloe-vst-persist 

`aloe-vst-persist` is a Rust crate facilitating advanced object data archiving specifically tailored for VST host and plug-in development. By providing interfaces for storing, retrieving, and iterating over object attributes, this crate aids in the communication and management of persistent object data between hosts and plug-ins, empowering developers with tools to handle presets and dynamic data effectively.

## Features
- Store, queue, and retrieve object data efficiently within an archive using unique attribute identifiers.
- Support for binary data storage and retrieval, providing low-level control over data persistence.
- Interfaces for iteration and enumeration over stored attributes, enhancing accessibility and management of data.
- Seamless integration with VST host architectures, adapting to common use cases in audio software development.

## Example Usage
```rust
use aloe_vst_persist::IAttributes;

fn main() {
    // Example setup and usage of attributes
    struct MyAttributes;
    impl IAttributes for MyAttributes {
        // Implement methods
    }

    let mut attributes = MyAttributes;
    // Set and retrieve data
}
```
