 from lines like:

    in the LICENSE file found in the top-level directory of this distribution
    and at www.steinberg.net/sdklicenses..."

 and from repeated disclaimers referencing "Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH"
 with years 2020, 2021, etc. There are also references to a 3-clause BSD style
 usage policy, e.g.:

   "Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without

    are met..."

 Additionally, some Steinberg files specify:
