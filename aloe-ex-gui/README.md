# Aloe EX-GUI

Aloe EX-GUI is a Rust crate that provides an extensive collection of example components and utilities for building rich, interactive user interfaces, leveraging native accessibility features and OpenGL rendering capabilities. It includes widgets, dialogs, menus, and toolbar implementations alongside OpenGL examples for complex graphic demonstrations.

## Overview

Aloe EX-GUI demonstrates a comprehensive suite of components ideal for both application and UI developers looking to extend their GUI functionality and interaction mechanisms in Rust. From simple widgets to complex components, this library facilitates a wide range of UI functionalities utilizing native capabilities and OpenGL rendering.

### Key Features
- **Component Demonstrations**: Includes numerous pre-built graphical user elements like buttons, sliders, and customizable demos.
- **OpenGL Integration**: Offers OpenGL drawable components and shader demonstrations, supporting interactive 2D and 3D graphics.
- **Extensive Accessibility**: Implements accessible UI elements with built-in support for screen readers and other accessibility tools.
- **Dynamic Configurations**: Customize component appearance and behavior dynamically through LookAndFeel settings.
- **Comprehensive Toolboxes**: Provides toolbars, menu, and component overview demonstrations for integrated UI management.

## Usage

Add `aloe-ex-gui` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-ex-gui = "0.1.0"
```

Then, you can start utilizing various components like `ToolbarDemoComp`, `DialogsDemo`, and shader utilities within the crate by importing them into your Rust project. Explore the included demos to understand how to effectively leverage graphical capabilities and UI interactions.

## Examples

### Creating a Custom Toolbar

Include the following code snippet in your Rust application to initialize and customize a toolbar:

```rust
use aloe_ex_gui::ToolbarDemoComp;

fn main() {
    let mut toolbar = ToolbarDemoComp::default();
    // Add custom toolbar items
    toolbar.customize_button.on_click(|_| { println!("Custom toolbar item clicked!"); });
}
```

### OpenGL Rendering with Custom Shader

```rust
use aloe_ex_gui::{OpenGLAppDemo, OpenGLDemo};

fn setup_opengl_demo() {
    let mut demo = OpenGLAppDemo::default();
    demo.set_shader_program("vertex_shader_code", "fragment_shader_code");
    demo.render();
}
```
