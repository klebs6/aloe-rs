# Aloe Positioning

Aloe Positioning is a Rust crate for dynamic coordinate management and relative positioning in GUI applications, leveraging an advanced system of relative coordinates, marker lists, and expressions to maintain adaptable and responsive component layouts.

## Features

- **Relative Point Paths**: Define paths that use dynamic relative points, allowing for flexible path manipulation and transformation.
- **Marker Lists**: Maintain sets of named markers along axes, enabling precise component alignment and adjustment.
- **Dynamic Resolution**: Utilize expressions to dynamically compute component positions and sizes based on sibling and parent relationships.
- **Sophisticated Coordinates**: Express and resolve coordinate positions using symbolic expressions, facilitating complex layout definitions.

## Getting Started

To integrate Aloe Positioning into your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-positioning = "0.1.0"
```

#### Examples

```rust
use aloe_positioning::{RelativePoint, RelativeRectangle};

// Define a relative point
let point = RelativePoint::from("1.0, 2.0");

// Create a relative rectangle
let rectangle = RelativeRectangle::new(
    &RelativeCoordinate::from("left"),
    &RelativeCoordinate::from("right"),
    &RelativeCoordinate::from("top"),
    &RelativeCoordinate::from("bottom")
);

// Apply to a component
rectangle.apply_to_component(&mut some_component);
```
