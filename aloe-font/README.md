# Aloe Font Crate

Aloe Font is a Rust library providing comprehensive tools for advanced font rendering and manipulation. This library excels in providing control over numerous font characteristics such as style, size, and kerning which are crucial for high-fidelity text rendering.

Explore complex font operations with elegantly designed enums and traits implementing behaviors like FontStyleFlags, WordWrap, and ReadingDirection, allowing seamless font style customization and text alignment.

### Features

- **Font Rendering**: Integrate sophisticated typeface management, perfect for applications requiring detailed font handling.
- **Style Manipulation**: Configure font attributes including bold, italic, and underlined styles through the `FontStyleFlags` enum.
- **Text Wrapping**: Dictate text layout using the `WordWrap` enum, enabling wrapping by word or character.
- **Reading Direction**: Switch text reading flows between natural, left-to-right, or right-to-left with the `ReadingDirection` enum.

### Usage Examples

Below is an illustrative example of how to use Aloe Font to render text:

```rust
use aloe_font::{Font, FontStyleFlags, WordWrap};

fn main() {
    // Create a font instance with different styles
    let font = Font::new_from_font_height_and_style_flags(12.0, FontStyleFlags::bold | FontStyleFlags::italic);
    
    // Setup word wrapping
    let wrap = WordWrap::byWord;
    
    // Render text using the configured font
    let text = "Typography is the art and technique of arranging type";
    let width = font.get_string_width(&text.to_string());
    println!("The computed width of the string is: {}", width);
}
```
