# Aloe Properties

Aloe Properties is a versatile Rust crate designed for manipulation and management of component properties in a GUI. It provides a structured approach via enums, traits, and structs to manage component appearances and interactions.

## Features

- **Color Management**: Manage component colors using `BooleanPropertyComponentColourIds` and `TextPropertyComponentColourIds` enums.
- **Storage Formats**: Save data using different storage formats such as Binary, Compressed Binary, or XML via `PropertiesFileStorageFormat`.
- **Property Components**: Derive various property components such as sliders, text boxes, and buttons by implementing interfaces like `PropertyComponentInterface`.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Define, manipulate, and retrieve property values efficiently with structures such as `PropertiesFile`, `PropertyPanel`, and `MultiChoicePropertyComponent`.

## Usage

Here is a quick example of using Aloe Properties in a Rust environment.

```rust
use aloe_properties::*;

// Instantiate and use as per component requirements
let mut color_id = BooleanPropertyComponentColourIds::backgroundColourId;
let storage_format = PropertiesFileStorageFormat::storeAsBinary;

// Implement required trait methods
impl PropertyComponentInterface for CustomComponent {
    // Implement trait methods
}

```

The crate streamlines property management and integrates tightly with GUI components, simplifying the creation of dynamic and interactive graphical interfaces.
