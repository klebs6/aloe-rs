# Aloe VST3

Aloe VST3 is a Rust crate for creating VST3 audio plugins. It enables seamless integration with digital audio workstations (DAWs) that support the VST3 plugin format.

Designed with a focus on performance and extendibility, Aloe VST3 provides comprehensive trait implementations and utility structures to facilitate plugin creation.

Features include a robust interface for MIDI event handling, component management, and parameter synchronization. Advanced configurations for bus arrangements and sample processing ensure compatibility across various audio environments.

## Usage
To utilize Aloe VST3 in your audio plugin development:

1. Add `aloe-vst3` as a dependency in your Cargo.toml:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   aloe-vst3 = "0.1.0"
   ```

2. Implement modules using provided traits like `DescriptionFactoryInterface`, `PerformOnDescription`, and `SetIComponentHandler`.

An example of initializing a VST3 component:

```rust
use aloe_vst3::{DescriptionFactoryInterface, PerformOnDescription};

struct MyPlugin;

impl DescriptionFactoryInterface for MyPlugin {}
impl PerformOnDescription for MyPlugin {
    fn perform_on_description(&mut self, description: &mut PluginDescription) -> Result<(), ()> {
        // Custom logic here
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

3. Handle MIDI and audio processing through `MidiEventList` and `ProcessData` respectively, ensuring thread-safe operations.

    ```rust
    fn process_audio(&mut self, data: &mut ProcessData) {
        // Processing implementations here
    }
    ```

## Features
- **MIDI Handling**: Robust support for MIDI input and output.
- **Component Management**: Traits like `SetIComponentHandler` and `ComponentRestarterListener` manage plugin lifecycle.
- **Parameter Management**: Efficient caching and synchronization of plugin parameters.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux/BSD environments.
