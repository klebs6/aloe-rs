# Aloe VST Message Crate

Aloe VST Message is a Rust crate that facilitates inter-component communication in VST3 host environments. It delivers a reliable and standardized means to send and receive private plugin messages through the VST framework, supporting both host and plug-in implementations.

## Overview

This crate defines two core traits: `IMessage` and `IConnectionPoint`. These traits allow for sophisticated messaging and connection management between VST components, adhering to the VST3 communication standards.

### IMessage

The `IMessage` trait enables the manipulation of VST communication messages, including setting and retrieving message IDs powered by the `FIDString` type. It also provides access to an `IAttributeList`, permitting the association of arbitrary attributes with messages transmitted between VST controller and editor components.

### IConnectionPoint

`IConnectionPoint` is responsible for establishing and controlling the communication pathways between VST components. It allows components to connect, disconnect, and send notifications utilizing instances of `IMessage`. This aids in creating modular and scalable audio solutions while maintaining efficient resource utilization within dynamic plugin networks.

## Usage

Incorporate `aloe-vst-message` into your VST3 plugin development projects to manage inter-component messaging with precision. Implementations of the `IMessage` and `IConnectionPoint` traits should conform to VST3 protocol ensuring compatibility and adherence to standardized host operations.
