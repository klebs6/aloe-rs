# Aloe Component

Aloe Component is a comprehensive Rust crate that provides a flexible and extensible interface for implementing user-interface components with support for accessibility and custom rendering. This crate contains a robust set of traits and enums that help manage the visual styling, event handling, and accessibility concerns for GUI applications built using Aloe.

## Features

- **Component Peer Style Flags**: Control GUI component appearance and behavior using flags such as `windowHasCloseButton`, `windowIsResizable`, etc.
- **Color Management**: Utilize `GroupComponentColourIds` to manage component aspect colors with ease, enhancing UI customizations.
- **Accessibility Support**: Implement `AccessibilityEvent` and `AccessibilityRole` to build accessible applications that conform to modern standards, ensuring they are usable by people with disabilities.
- **Flexible Rendering Engine**: Customize rendering engines through traits such as `GetAvailableRenderingEngines` and `SetCurrentRenderingEngine`.

## Usage

### Basic Structure

```rust
pub enum ComponentPeerStyleFlags {
    windowAppearsOnTaskbar,
    windowIsTemporary,
    windowIgnoresMouseClicks,
    ...
}

pub enum AccessibilityEvent {
    valueChanged,
    titleChanged,
    ...
}

pub trait Paint {
    fn paint(&mut self, g: &mut Graphics);
}

pub trait EnablementChanged {
    fn enablement_changed(&mut self);
}
```

### Implementing a Component

Here's a small example of how to create a custom component that responds to accessibility events and custom painting:

```rust
struct MyComponent;

impl Paint for MyComponent {
    fn paint(&mut self, g: &mut Graphics) {
        // Custom drawing logic here
    }
}

impl EnablementChanged for MyComponent {
    fn enablement_changed(&mut self) {
        // React to changes in enablement state
    }
}
```

This crate is ideal for those who wish to develop desktop applications with intricate component behavior and appearance, while maintaining robust accessibility support.
