# Aloe-Network

Aloe-Network is a Rust crate designed to facilitate network communication using a variety of protocols and utilities. It provides low-level constructs for socket management, along with abstractions for asynchronous updates and message callbacks. The crate is robust in handling both TCP and UDP socket communications and offers extended capabilities such as network service discovery and data streaming from web resources.

## Features

- **StreamingSocket**: A TCP socket handler supporting synchronous and asynchronous communication.
- **DatagramSocket**: A UDP handler allowing quick and lightweight datagram transmissions.
- **Network Service Discovery**: Broadcasts and listens for network services, allowing automatic service recognition.
- **Asynchronous Updating Mechanism**: Simplifies queuing and executing tasks asynchronously without manual thread handling.
- **WebInputStream**: HTTP input stream that reads data over the network from a specified URL, supporting header management and stream positioning.

## Getting Started

To use Aloe-Network, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-network = "0.1.0"
```

### Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_network::{StreamingSocket, DatagramSocket, NetworkServiceDiscoveryAdvertiser};

fn example() {
    // Create a new TCP streaming socket
    let mut socket = StreamingSocket::default();
    socket.connect("example.com", 80, None);

    // Create a new Datagram socket
    let udp_socket = DatagramSocket::new(Some(true));

    // Advertise a network service
    let advertiser = NetworkServiceDiscoveryAdvertiser::new(&"_example._tcp", &"Example Service", 0, 5000, None);
}
```

## Advanced Topics

### TCP/IP Networking
Aloe-Network offers robust socket interfaces that are cross-platform and handle both IPv4 and IPv6. 

### Event-Driven Programming
The crate is designed with asynchronous programming paradigms in mind, allowing apps to handle network events and updates efficiently.

### Network Service Discovery
Facilitates automatic service discovery over a network using broadcasting features, suitable for scalable and dynamic service environments.
