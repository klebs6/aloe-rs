# aloe-delay

`aloe-delay` is a sophisticated Rust crate designed for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications, specifically focusing on implementing delay line processing with fractional delay calculation capabilities. The crate offers a variety of interpolation algorithms useful in both static and dynamically modulated delay scenarios. Its architecture supports block processing and sample-by-sample processing, making it ideal for creating complex audio effects such as delay effects with feedback.

## Features

- **Interpolation Algorithms:** Supports multiple interpolation algorithms including Linear, Thiran, Lagrange (third-order), and Vanilla (no interpolation).
- **Real-Time Processing:** Efficiently handles modulated and unmodulated delay lines, enabling real-time audio processing applications.
- **Flexibility:** Designed for high adaptability with the ability to update delay parameters dynamically and process audio in various formats.
- **Ease of Use:** Provides simple API for setting up delay lines, processing audio blocks, and experimenting with different interpolation techniques.

## Technical Background

This crate leverages mathematical principles for fractional delay calculation, crucial for precise audio signal manipulation. The interpolation strategies employed, such as Lagrange and Thiran, are rooted in well-established mathematical frameworks, optimizing the balance between computational efficiency and audio fidelity.

## Usage

To use `aloe-delay`, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-delay = "0.1.0"
```

You can set up a delay line as follows:

```rust
use aloe_delay::{LinearDelayLine, SampleInterpolationBehavior};

let mut delay_line: LinearDelayLine<f32> = DelayLine::new(maximum_delay_in_samples);
delay_line.set_delay(220.0); // Set desired delay
```

### Example

```rust
use aloe_delay::LinearDelayLine;

fn main() {
    let mut delay = LinearDelayLine::new(44100); // Delay line with 1 second max delay at 44.1kHz sample rate
    delay.set_delay(500.0); // Set delay to 500 samples
    // Process audio here
}
```

## Note
For real-time applications where delay parameters need to be modulated, it is recommended to smooth transitions using a ramp function or low-pass filter to avoid audio artifacts.
