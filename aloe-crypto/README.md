# Aloe-Crypto

**Aloe-Crypto** is a Rust library designed for robust cryptographic operations. It provides an interface for various hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, Whirlpool) and encryption techniques (RSA key pair, Blowfish, etc.) to enable secure data management.

## Features

- **MD5 Checksum**: Computes the MD5 checksum of a data block or stream and returns the result as a 16-byte array or hex string.
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Generates a secure SHA-256 hash with capabilities for conversion to raw byte data or a hex string representation.
- **Whirlpool Hashing**: As a stronger alternative, the Whirlpool hashing function captures comprehensive security with an advanced hash output.
- **RSA Encryption**: Supports creation and usage of RSA public/private key pairs for secure encryption and decryption operations, with examples included for PHP and Java.
- **Blowfish Encryption**: Utilizes Blowfish for encrypting and decrypting data, with details on key-length and buffer handling.
- **Prime Number Generation**: Employs efficient algorithms for the creation and testing of prime numbers essential for cryptographic calculations.

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_crypto::{MD5, RSAKey};

// MD5 checksum
let md5 = MD5::new_from_chars("Example data");
println!("MD5 Checksum: {}", md5.to_hex_string());

// RSA Key creation and usage
let mut public_key = RSAKey::default();
let mut private_key = RSAKey::default();
RSAKey::create_key_pair(&mut public_key, &mut private_key, 2048, None, None);
```

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-crypto = "0.1.0"
```

This crate is a translation of the JUCE module.

JUCE is a c++ software framework for developing high performance audio applications.

Usage falls under the GPLv3 as well as the JUCE commercial license.

See github.com/juce-framework/JUCE and the JUCE license page for details.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. As such, some of its features may be pending-translation. For progress updates, please see the workspacer rust project. workspacer contains a growing set of utilities designed specifically for rust projects.
