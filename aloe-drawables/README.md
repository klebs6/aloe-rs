# Aloe Drawables

Aloe Drawables is a Rust crate designed to provide a comprehensive suite of drawable objects through the use of traits and structured types. It offers a highly organized framework for rendering graphical elements, making it ideal for graphical user interfaces and other visualization applications.

## Overview

The core of the Aloe Drawables crate is the `Drawable` trait, alongside several key traits that provide additional capabilities for drawable objects:

- **`DrawableDeepCopy`**: Enables the creation of deep copies of drawable objects.
- **`DrawableGetOutlineAsPath`**: Retrieves the outline of a drawable object as a path, aiding in both rendering and hit-testing.
- **`DrawableGetDrawableBounds`**: Provides the axis-aligned bounding box of a drawable object, simplifying layout calculations.
- **`DrawableReplaceColour`**: Allows for the replacement of specified colours within the drawable elements, offering dynamic visual alterations.

## Core Structures

- **`DrawableImage`**: Represents bitmap images with attributes for opacity, overlay colour, and bounds.
- **`DrawableShape`**: A base class for shapes with filled and stroked outlines, supporting complex rendering styles.
- **`DrawableRectangle`**: Specialized for rendering rectangles, with capabilities for rounded corners and size adjustments.
- **`DrawableComposite`**: Acts as a container managing a hierarchy of drawable objects, handling transformations and bounds.
- **`DrawableText`**: Dedicated to rendering text, with settings for font, size, colour, and justification.
- **`DrawablePath`**: Represents shapes and outlines defined by vector paths.

## Usage

### Creating a Drawable Image
```rust
let image = DrawableImage::new(&your_image);
image.set_opacity(0.8);
image.set_overlay_colour(Colour::new_rgb(0, 0, 0));
```

### Drawing Shapes
```rust
let mut shape = DrawableRectangle::default();
shape.set_rectangle(Parallelogram::from_coords(0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 100.0));
shape.set_corner_size(Point::new(5.0, 5.0));
```

### Managing a Composite Drawable
```rust
let mut composite = DrawableComposite::default();
composite.add_child(Box::new(shape));
```

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-drawables = "0.1.0"
```
