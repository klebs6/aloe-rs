# Aloe-Oboe Counters

Aloe-Oboe Counters offers a robust, non-atomic, 64-bit monotonic counter capable of tracking 32-bit wrapping or resettable counters. This crate is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, delivering high-performance counting solutions.

## Overview

The core of this crate is the `MonotonicCounter` struct, enabling seamless transitions between 32-bit and 64-bit counter representations. It solves common concurrency issues associated with counter overflow by consolidating 32-bit counters into a monotonic 64-bit counter.

## Features

- Non-atomic operations: Lightweight counters intended for single-threaded contexts or user-managed locking for multi-threaded scenarios.
- Seamless conversion of 32-bit wrapping counters by utilizing sound signal theory (Nyquist rate principle) to ensure precision.
- Customizable operations on counters, including resetting and rounding functions, facilitate enhanced usage adaptability.

## Usage

Integrate the crate by including it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-counters = "0.1.0"
```

Utilize the `MonotonicCounter` to manage counting tasks:

```rust
use aloe_oboe_counters::MonotonicCounter;

let mut counter = MonotonicCounter::default();
counter.set(100);
counter.increment(10);
assert_eq!(counter.get(), 110);
```

## Note

Ensure external synchronization when using the counter in multi-threaded applications to prevent race conditions.
