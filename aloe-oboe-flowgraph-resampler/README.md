# Aloe-Oboe Flowgraph Resampler

The `aloe-oboe-flowgraph-resampler` crate offers a comprehensive suite of tools for multi-channel audio resampling. Its primary focus is on optimizing audio processing pipelines by utilizing sophisticated resampling techniques, including multi-channel resamplers and advanced windowing functions.

## Features

- **MultiChannelResampler:** Core of the crate, facilitating adjustable quality and performance through `MultiChannelResamplerQuality` enum settings.
- **High-Performance Resampler Implementations:** Includes types like `PolyphaseResampler`, `SincResampler`, and `LinearResampler`, each supporting varying computational efficiency and quality ratios.
- **Advanced Window Functions:** Incorporates `ResamplerKaiserWindow` and `HyperbolicCosineWindow` for precise filter design with tunable characteristics.
- **Flowgraph Support:** `FlowgraphRampLinear` provides seamless transition management of control values, minimizing audio artifacts during parameter changes.

## Usage

To employ resampling, instantiate a resampler builder such as `MultiChannelSamplerBuilder`, configure its properties (e.g., input/output rates), and build the desired resampler type. For example:

```rust
let mut builder = MultiChannelSamplerBuilder::default();
builder.set_input_rate(48000)
       .set_output_rate(44100)
       .set_num_taps(16)
       .set_channel_count(2);

let resampler = builder.build();
```

## Technical Insights

The crate centers around precise control of audio sample `phase`, leveraging integer ratios of input/output rates for performance gains. It precomputes coefficients for optimal efficiency during frame processing, reducing computational overhead associated with frequently changing ratios.
