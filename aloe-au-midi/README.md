# aloe-au-midi

`aloe-au-midi` is a Rust library offering an interface for integrating MIDI events with Audio Unit components. It provides robust functionalities to handle different types of MIDI messages, including note, control, and system exclusive (SysEx) messages.

## Key Features

- **MIDI Event Handling**: Efficiently process and dispatch various MIDI events such as note on/off, control change, and pitch wheel.
- **MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx)**: Manage SysEx messages for advanced MIDI communications.
- **Property Management**: Delegate functions for getting and setting Audio Unit properties, critical for interaction with MIDI map managers and handling property changes.
- **Audio Unit Integration**: Suitable for applications requiring low-level MIDI handling in conjunction with Audio Unit bases for Mac OS X.

## Technical Overview

The core functionality centers around the `AUMidiBaseInterface` trait, which describes methods for MIDI handling and Audio Unit interaction. Key methods include:

- `midi_event` and `sys_ex`: To handle incoming MIDI status and data.
- `handle_midi_event` and `handle_non_note_event`: Specialized callbacks for note-specific and other event types.
- `get_midi_map_manager`: Access MIDI map management for parameter mappings.

## Getting Started

To include `aloe-au-midi` in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-midi = "0.1.0"
```

## Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_au_midi::AUMidiBaseInterface;

struct MyMidiHandler;

impl AUMidiBaseInterface for MyMidiHandler {
    // Implement trait methods as needed...
}

fn main() {
    let mut handler = MyMidiHandler;
    // Handle your MIDI logic...
}
```
