# Aloe Audio Source Player

Aloe Audio Source Player is a robust Rust crate designed to facilitate continuous audio streaming from an audio source to an `AudioIODevice`. It acts as an `AudioIODeviceCallback`, enabling seamless attachment to output devices and efficient audio streaming from an `AudioSource`. Designed for advanced audio management and manipulation, it offers precise control over audio playback and gain settings.

## Features
- **Continuous Audio Streaming**: Facilitates uninterrupted audio flow from sources to devices.
- **Flexible Source Management**: Easily changeable audio sources with resource management.
- **Gain Control**: Fine-tuned gain adjustments for optimal audio output.
- **Device Compatibility**: Integrates seamlessly with various `AudioIODevice` interfaces.

## Usage
This crate is initialized via the `AudioSourcePlayer` struct, offering a straightforward interface for audio device callbacks. Observe proper setup with `prepare_to_play`, and ensure gain is correctly applied using `set_gain`.

```rust
use aloe_audio_source_player::AudioSourcePlayer;

let mut player = AudioSourcePlayer::default();

player.prepare_to_play(44100.0, 1024);
player.set_gain(0.75);

// Attach AudioSource and AudioIODevice as needed
```

## Installation
Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
