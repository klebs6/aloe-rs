# Aloe Caret Component

The `aloe-caret-component` crate offers a custom caret component suitable for GUI applications, primarily catering to developers employing the Rust programming language. This library is designed to operate seamlessly in environments adhering to the 2024 Rust edition, licensed under GPL-3.0.

## Features

- **Customizable Colors:** Define and manipulate caret colors using `CaretComponentColourIds`, facilitating a vibrant user interface development. Color types can be set using `Component::setColour()` or `LookAndFeel::setColour()` methods.
- **Keyboard Focus Sensitivity:** The caret only displays under specific conditions of keyboard focus, ensuring efficient visibility control, thereby mitigating unnecessary screen clutter.
- **Integrated with Timer:** Utilize a timer to handle the dynamic visibility of the caret, maintaining its presence on an interval of 380ms, contributing to precise frame timing in maintaining visual consistency.

## Usage
The `CaretComponent` is highly adaptive, supporting a variety of applications due to its non-intrusive design. Its main structure provides robust functionality to define where, how, and when a caret appears. Utilize the `SetCaretPosition` trait to specify the caret's location within a given `Rectangle`.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_caret_component::CaretComponent;

let owner = /* acquire owner component */;
let caret = CaretComponent::new(owner);

// Paint the caret
caret.paint(&mut graphics_context);

// Set the position of the caret
caret.set_caret_position(&some_character_area);
```

## Installation
The crate is available via [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/aloe-caret-component) and can be added to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-caret-component = "0.1.0"
