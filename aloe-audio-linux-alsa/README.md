# Aloe Audio Linux ALSA

Aloe Audio Linux ALSA provides a comprehensive interface with useful abstractions for interacting with ALSA audio devices on Linux platforms. Tailored for audio hardware interfacing, this crate encapsulates robust components such as `ALSAAudioIODeviceType`, `ALSAAudioIODevice`, `ALSAThread`, and `ALSADevice`, essential for efficient audio processing, device management, and real-time audio stream manipulation.

## Features
- **Device Enumeration and Management**: Seamlessly scan and manage both ALSA soundcards and PCM devices, allowing for flexible configurations.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements enhanced logging and error recovery mechanisms to ensure reliable audio processing workflows.
- **Stream Configuration**: Utilize functions to define audio stream parameters such as sample rates, buffer sizes, and channel configurations.
- **Interleaved and Non-Interleaved Audio Data Support**: Customize audio data handling and conversion to cater to diverse applications.

## Integration
By employing this crate, users have fine-grained control over ALSA audio devices, enabling professional-grade audio applications that demand low latency and high performance.

## Example Usage

```rust
fn main() {
    // Example code for initializing an ALSA device
    let alsa_device = ALSADevice::new("hw:0", true);
    alsa_device.open(44100, 2, 512);
}
```

Designed to be used within larger audio systems, this crate allows for rapid development and deployment of audio applications on Linux systems utilizing ALSA.
