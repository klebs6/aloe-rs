# aloe-callout-box

The `aloe-callout-box` crate provides a sophisticated solution for implementing temporary pop-up windows in graphical user interfaces. A `CallOutBox` is a versatile component that provides a modal-like display, useful for showing additional controls when a user interacts with a button or other GUI component.

## Capabilities
- **Dynamic Display**: Features an arrow indicating the target component or area, enhancing user experience through visual cues. Ideal for creating a more intuitive and interactive user interface.
- **Asynchronous Launch**: Uses the `launch_asynchronously` method to dynamically manage the lifetime of a CallOutBox, avoiding traditional modal loops and enhancing performance.
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adjusts its size and position to accommodate the content component, while respecting the constraints of a designated area within the parent component or desktop.
- **Customizability**: Offers functions to modify the arrow size and change dismissal behavior by either consuming mouse clicks or passing them to underlying components.
- **Flexible Callback System**: Supports customizable behavior through `CallOutBoxCallback`, allowing for additional user-specific functionalities. 

## Installation
To use `aloe-callout-box`, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-callout-box = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
Instantiate a new `CallOutBox` using:
```rust
let mut content: Box<Component> = Box::new(FoobarContentComp::default());
content.set_size(300, 300);
let area = Rectangle::new(10, 10, 300, 300);
let callout = CallOutBox::launch_asynchronously(content, area, std::ptr::null_mut());
```
