# Aloe-ADSR

Aloe-ADSR is a simple and efficient library providing an ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope generator for audio processing in Rust applications. It is designed to modulate the amplitude of audio signals over time according to the ADSR model often used in electronic music synthesis. This crate enables seamless integration with your audio processing code by offering convenient methods to manage envelope states and apply them to audio buffers.

## Features

- **ADSR Envelope Handling**: Manage the state transitions (idle, attack, decay, sustain, release) effectively.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Set custom attack, decay, sustain, and release times.
- **Sample Rate Configuration**: Define operating sample rates for precise control over envelope timing.
- **Buffer Application**: Calculate and apply envelope curves to entire audio buffers efficiently.

## Crate Documentation
### Enumerations
- `AdsrState`: Represents the current state of the ADSR envelope, with possible states being idle, attack, decay, sustain, and release.

### Structures
- `ADSR`: The main struct representing the envelope generator, handling state transitions, and providing methods to manipulate the envelope processing.
- `AdsrParameters`: A supporting struct to hold the current ADSR parameters such as attack, decay, sustain, and release times.

## Usage
Here's a basic usage example:
```rust
use aloe_adsr::{ADSR, AdsrParameters};

fn main() {
    let mut adsr = ADSR::default();
    let params = AdsrParameters::new(0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1);

    adsr.set_sample_rate(44100.0);
    adsr.set_parameters(&params);

    adsr.note_on();
    let sample = adsr.get_next_sample();
    println!("Sample Value: {}", sample);

    adsr.note_off();
    let release_sample = adsr.get_next_sample();
    println!("Release Sample Value: {}", release_sample);
}
```
