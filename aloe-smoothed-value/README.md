# aloe-smoothed-value

`aloe-smoothed-value` is a Rust crate designed to provide efficient audio processing tools for smoothing numerical values in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) tasks. Specifically, it enables developers to implement both linear and multiplicative smoothing techniques when handling values that require transition smoothing, such as audio signals, to minimize artifacts or glitches.

## Features

- **Linear Smoothing**: Smooths values linearly, allowing seamless transitions by incrementally moving towards the target value with constant step sizes. This is typically useful for linearly related parameters.

- **Multiplicative Smoothing**: Executes smoothing with an exponential or logarithmic approach, ideal for parameters such as frequencies or volume (dB), where values inherently follow a multiplicative scale.

- **Logarithmic Ramp**: Facilitates smoothed value transitions where adjustments occur logarithmically, particularly useful for ramping audio parameters that are best perceived on a log scale.

## Usage

To use this crate, specify it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-smoothed-value = "0.1.0"
```

Import and deploy the `SmoothedValue` types:

```rust
use aloe_smoothed_value::{LinearSmoothedValue, MultiplicativeSmoothedValue};

let mut smooth_val = LinearSmoothedValue::new(0.0);
smooth_val.set_target_value(1.0);
...
let current_value = smooth_val.get_next_value();
```

### SmoothedValue API

Provides essential operations to define and manage both linear and multiplicative smoothing techniques:

- **`set_target_value(new_value)`**: Set a new target value to transition toward.
- **`get_next_value()`**: Compute the next smoothed value towards the target.
- **`reset(new_num_steps)`**: Reconfigure the ramp length in number of steps.

### LogRampedValue API

Behavior configurable through:

- **`set_log_parameters(mid_point_amplitudedb, rate_of_change_should_increase)`**: Control the logarithmic ramp behavior and rate dynamic.

## Example

```rust
let mut log_smooth = LogRampedValue::new(0.5);
log_smooth.set_log_parameters(-12.0, true);
log_smooth.set_target_value(1.0);
while log_smooth.is_smoothing() {
    let value = log_smooth.get_next_value();
    // Apply `value` in the audio processing loop
}
```
