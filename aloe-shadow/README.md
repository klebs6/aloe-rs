# Aloe-Shadow

The `aloe-shadow` crate provides a sophisticated system for managing drop shadows around graphical components in GUI applications. Its inherent architecture ensures seamless integration with the component lifecycle, effectively augmenting components with dynamic, Gaussian blurs that mimic realistic shadow effects.

## Features
- **Dynamic Shadow Management**: Automatically creates and manages shadow components around target components, ensuring shadows adapt to movement and layering changes.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Leverages desktop settings and parent component structures to efficiently render shadows without unnecessary resource consumption.
- **Comprehensive API**: Offers straightforward APIs for integrating and controlling shadow behavior within your application.

## Getting Started
To leverage the shadowing capabilities, instantiate the `DropShadower` and attach it to your component:

```rust
use aloe_shadow::{DropShadow, DropShadower, Component};

let shadow = DropShadow::default();
let drop_shadower = DropShadower::new(&shadow);

// Assuming `component` is your target graphical component
unsafe { drop_shadower.set_owner(component); }
```

## Technical Details
The crate operates by creating `ShadowWindow` instances that obscure component outlines with calculated shadow effects. Shadows maintain position and visibility parity with their associated components, and adapt to changes in the component hierarchy.

### Core Structures
- **`ShadowWindow`**: Manages the shadow rendering for individual graphical components.
- **`DropShadower`**: A high-level manager that coordinates shadow windows for entire applications.

## Requirements
Ensure that your graphical components are compatible with the `Component` trait from the environment you operate in. The crate is optimized for desktop GUI systems that permit transparent window layering.
