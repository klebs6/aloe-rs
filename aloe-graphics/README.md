# Aloe Graphics Crate

Aloe Graphics is a comprehensive Rust library designed for advanced graphics rendering, providing a rich set of tools for image manipulation, graphical effects, and custom rendering contexts. It supports high-quality resampling and sophisticated rendering techniques to meet the demands of a variety of graphical applications, from simple UI elements to complex vector graphics.

## Features

- **Resampling Quality**: Control over image resampling quality with options for low, medium, and high settings to balance performance and quality.
- **Image Effects**: Trait-based architecture for applying effects like blurs and shadows to images pre-rendering.
- **Custom Renderers**: Interface for creating different types of graphics contexts, allowing rendering via software or hardware acceleration.
- **Gradient and Color Management**: Advanced color and gradient handling that includes solid colors, gradients, and tiled images for fills.
- **Vector and Raster Graphics**: Comprehensive support for vector graphics with transforms, path handling, and enhanced stroke/path capabilities.

## Getting Started

Add `aloe-graphics` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-graphics = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example to demonstrate drawing a gradient-filled rectangle:

```rust
use aloe_graphics::{Graphics, FillType, ColourGradient, Rectangle, Colour};

fn main() {
    let mut graphics = Graphics::new();
    let gradient = ColourGradient::new(Colour::red(), Colour::blue());
    let fill = FillType::from_gradient(gradient);
    let rect = Rectangle::new(0, 0, 100, 200);
    
    graphics.set_fill_type(&fill);
    graphics.fill_rect(&rect);
}
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation with examples is available to guide users through all features of the library, from basic drawing commands to implementing custom rendering contexts.

## Implementation Notes

Aloe Graphics is designed with extensibility in mind, facilitating the creation of highly specific rendering logic for different use cases, including real-time applications and complex image processing tasks.
