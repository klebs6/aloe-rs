# Aloe Oscillator

**Aloe Oscillator** is a highly flexible and efficient digital signal processing (DSP) library written in Rust, designed to generate audio signals based on user-supplied mathematical functions. The crate provides robust mechanisms for creating oscillators with customizable parameters, supporting a diverse range of waveform generation techniques including sine, saw, and square waves.

The library is tailored for high-performance applications, offering tools to easily adjust frequency, gain, and mix, making it a powerful tool for audio software development, musical signal processing, and electronic sound synthesis.

## Features

- Configurable Oscillator Types: Supports sine, saw, and square waveforms with or without table-based approximations.
- Dynamic Frequency Adjustment: Alter the frequency responsively with support for ramping.
- Signal Manipulation: Apply gain adjustments and mixing, integrating with broader audio processing contexts.
- High Modularity: The architecture allows seamless integration and expansion.
- Audio Block Management: Efficient handling of input and output audio blocks ensures effective real-time processing.

## Getting Started

To get started, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oscillator = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_oscillator::OscillatorDemoDSP;

fn main() {
    let mut dsp = OscillatorDemoDSP::default();
    dsp.prepare(&spec);
    dsp.process(&context);
    dsp.reset();
}
```
