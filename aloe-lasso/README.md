# Aloe Lasso

Aloe Lasso provides powerful GUI components to enable intuitive, rectangular selection interfaces in Rust applications, leveraging the power of the Rust programming language to offer performance and safety. This crate lets developers easily integrate the concept of mouse-driven lasso selection into their graphical applications.

## Features

- **LassoComponent:** A core struct representing a draggable, rectangular selection region. It can be employed in GUIs to select a group of items visually and interactively.
- **LassoSource Trait:** Defines a mechanism for the LassoComponent to identify which items fall within the drawn lasso region, thus managing the selected items effectively.
- **Extensible Color Customization:** Allows customization through `LassoComponentColourIds` by setting colors for the fill and outline of the lasso area.

## Usage

### `LassoComponent` Utilization:
- **Initialization:** Attach the `LassoComponent` to a parent component during `mouseDown` event and initialize with `begin_lasso()`.
- **Dragging:** Update the lasso position and selection via `drag_lasso()` during `mouseDrag`.
- **Termination:** Finalize the process by calling `end_lasso()` at the `mouseUp` event.

### Modifier Key Support:
- **Shift Key:** Adds lassoed items to existing selections.
- **Ctrl/Command Key:** Toggles lassoed items with existing selections.

## Example
```rust
use aloe_lasso::{LassoComponent, LassoSource};

// Define your selectable item type
struct MyItem;

// Implement the LassoSource trait for your item set
impl LassoSource<MyItem> for MyItemSet { /* ... */ }

// Initialize a LassoComponent
todo!(); // Initialization and use of LassoComponent
```
