# Aloe Visualizer

Aloe Visualizer is a Rust library offering a straightforward solution for rendering scrolling waveforms from audio data. Ideal for rapid development scenarios that require quick insight into audio signal visualizations, it eschews complexity for simplicity and ease of use by providing essential functionality through a basic API.

## Features

- **Component Design**: `AudioVisualiserComponent` forms the core, encapsulating methods to manage waveform visualization over multiple channels.
- **Customization**: Modify buffer size, channel count, and repaint rate. Basic color settings enable straightforward aesthetic adjustments.
- **Data Handling**: Use methods like `push_buffer` and `push_sample` to feed audio data into the visualizer, leveraging its efficient internal data management systems.
- **Painting Interface**: Allows overriding the default `paint` method to suit bespoke visualization needs, with tools for converting waveform data into drawable paths.

## Usage

Start by creating an instance of the `AudioVisualiserComponent` with the desired number of channels:

```rust
let mut visualizer = AudioVisualiserComponent::new(2);
visualizer.set_samples_per_block(256);
visualizer.set_buffer_size(1024);
```

Feed audio data using:

```rust
visualizer.push_buffer(&audio_buffer);
```

Customize appearance:

```rust
visualizer.set_colours(Colour::black(), Colour::white());
```

## Example

The visualizer serves as an exemplary addition to audio processing applications where visual feedback on waveform dynamics is beneficial, such as audio editors or real-time monitoring tools.
