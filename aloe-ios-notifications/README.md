# Aloe iOS Notifications

Aloe iOS Notifications is a Rust library providing seamless integration and management of iOS local and remote push notifications. Leveraging the Rust-ObjC interface, this crate bridges the gap between native iOS notification handling mechanisms and Rust's powerful ecosystem.

## Features

- **Push Notifications**: Supports registering, sending, and handling push notifications across iOS versions.
- **Local Notifications**: Facilitates scheduling and managing local notifications with customizable alerts, sounds, and badges.
- **Actionable Notifications**: Provides utilities for handling interactive notification actions, including text input responses.
- **Notification Categories**: Create and manage notification categories with specific actions tailored to application needs.

## Interface

### Trait Definition

```rust
pub trait PushNotificationsDelegateInterface {
    fn did_register_user_notification_settings(&mut self, notification_settings: *mut UIUserNotificationSettings);
    fn registered_for_remote_notifications(&mut self, device_token: *mut NSData);
    fn failed_to_register_for_remote_notifications(&mut self, error: *mut NSError);
    fn did_receive_remote_notification(&mut self, user_info: *mut NSDictionary<NSObject,NSObject>);
    fn did_receive_remote_notification_fetch_completion_handler(&mut self, user_info: *mut NSDictionary<NSObject,NSObject>, completion_handler: fn(result: UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> c_void);
    ...
}
```

### Struct Definitions

The library defines several iOS-specific structures such as `UIApplication`, `UILocalNotification`, `UIUserNotificationSettings`, etc., to offer full-fledged notification support.

### Implementations

Seamlessly transform between custom Rust structures and native iOS notification representations, ensuring robust notification lifecycle management.

## Usage

This crate is designed to be used with Rust edition 2024. Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-ios-notifications = "0.1.0"
```

Ensure that you have the necessary iOS-specific setup in your Xcode project to leverage full notification functionality through this crate.
