 *
 * When the chroma components are to be upsampled by simple replication
 * (ie, box filtering), we can save some work in color conversion by
 * calculating all the output pixels corresponding to a pair of chroma
 * samples at one time.  In the conversion equations
 *  R = Y           + K1 * Cr
 *  G = Y + K2 * Cb + K3 * Cr
 *  B = Y + K4 * Cb
 * only the Y term varies among the group of pixels corresponding to a pair
 * of chroma samples, so the rest of the terms can be calculated just once.
 * At typical sampling ratios, this eliminates half or three-quarters of the
 * multiplications needed for color conversion.
 *
 * This file currently provides implementations for the following cases:
 *  YCbCr => RGB color conversion only.
 *  Sampling ratios of 2h1v or 2h2v.
 *  No scaling needed at upsample time.
 *  Corner-aligned (non-CCIR601) sampling alignment.
 * Other special cases could be added, but in most applications these are
 * the only common cases.  (For uncommon cases we fall back on the more
 * general code in jdsample.c and jdcolor.c.)

 * This file contains a floating-point implementation of the
 * forward DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).
 *
 * This implementation should be more accurate than either of the integer
 * DCT implementations.  However, it may not give the same results on all
 * machines because of differences in roundoff behavior.  Speed will depend
 * on the hardware's floating point capacity.
 *
 * A 2-D DCT can be done by 1-D DCT on each row followed by 1-D DCT
 * on each column.  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are
 * much more complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.
 *
 * This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
 * scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
 * Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
 * JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
 * is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
 * While an 8-point DCT cannot be done in less than 11 multiplies, it is
 * possible to arrange the computation so that many of the multiplies are
 * simple scalings of the final outputs.  These multiplies can then be
 * folded into the multiplications or divisions by the JPEG quantization
 * table entries.  The AA&N method leaves only 5 multiplies and 29 adds
 * to be done in the DCT itself.
 * The primary disadvantage of this method is that with a fixed-point
 * implementation, accuracy is lost due to imprecise representation of the
 * scaled quantization values.  However, that problem does not arise if
 * we use floating point arithmetic.

 *
 * This file contains simple error-reporting and trace-message routines.
 * These are suitable for Unix-like systems and others where writing to
 * stderr is the right thing to do.  Many applications will want to replace
 * some or all of these routines.
 *
 * If you define USE_WINDOWS_MESSAGEBOX in jconfig.h or in the makefile,
 * you get a Windows-specific hack to display error messages in a dialog box.
 * It ain't much, but it beats dropping error messages into the bit bucket,
 * which is what happens to output to stderr under most Windows C compilers.
 *
 * These routines are used by both the compression and decompression code.
