# aloe-au-device

## Overview

`aloe-au-device` offers a foundational library for managing virtual music devices using Rust. This crate is designed to handle MIDI events, SysEx data, property management, note handling, and moreâ€”integrating effectively with audio unit components. It provides advanced capabilities for creating and manipulating audio processing chains, setting a robust framework for developers dealing with audio synthesis and manipulation in music applications.

## Features

- **MIDI Event Management**: Capture and process MIDI events with fine granularity.
- **SysEx Data Handling**: Send and receive System Exclusive messages across devices.
- **Property Handling**: Easily get and set properties relating to audio units and music devices.
- **Note Control**: Comprehensive note-on and note-off handling with adjustable parameters.

## Usage

The crate encapsulates the core `MusicDeviceBaseInterface` trait, bringing together a suite of functionalities for audio device control.

```rust
use aloe_au_device::MusicDeviceBaseInterface;

// Implement the `MusicDeviceBaseInterface` for your custom struct.
struct MyMusicDevice;

impl MusicDeviceBaseInterface for MyMusicDevice {
    fn midi_event(&mut self, in_status: u32, in_data1: u32, in_data2: u32, in_offset_sample_frame: u32) -> OSStatus {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
    // Other method implementations...
}
```
