# Aloe ProgressBar

Aloe ProgressBar is a sophisticated graphical component for tracking and displaying progress in your Rust applications. Specifically engineered for use in GUI environments, this component autonomously updates its visual representation of progress as the associated variable is modified.

```rust
use aloe_progressbar::ProgressBar;

let mut progress_value = 0.0;
let mut progress_bar = ProgressBar::new(&mut progress_value);

progress_bar.set_percentage_display(true);
    // or to set a custom message
progress_bar.set_text_to_display(&"Processing...".to_string());
```

## Features

- **Autonomous Update:** The `ProgressBar` monitors progress variables and redraws itself when changes occur.
- **Customizable Display:** Enable or disable percentage display, or set a custom text.
- **Adaptive Layout:** Automatically adjusts layout to circular or linear based on dimensions.
- **Integrative with Threads:** Compatible with the `ThreadWithProgressWindow` class for background task progress monitoring.

## Implementation Details

The rendering logic allows for smooth integration with the Aloe LookAndFeel, supporting both linear and circular representations depending on the dimensions. For values outside the conventional range (0.0 to 1.0), the component utilizes spinning animations to symbolize progress.

### Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut progress = 0.5;
    let progress_bar = ProgressBar::new(&mut progress);

    // Update progress somewhere in the application
    progress = 0.75;
}
```

## Documentation

The core functionality centers around observing a mutable reference to a floating-point numerical progress representation. Additional methods such as `set_percentage_display` and `set_text_to_display` allow further customization.
