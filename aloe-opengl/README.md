# aloe-opengl

`aloe-opengl` is a sophisticated Rust crate designed to provide advanced OpenGL functionality. It offers a comprehensive suite of OpenGL utilities and extensions to facilitate graphics rendering. The crate is particularly useful for developers working on graphics applications requiring fine control over OpenGL contexts, shaders, textures, and rendering pipelines.

## Features

- **Advanced OpenGL Context Management**: Supports efficient management and manipulation of OpenGL contexts, including attaching and detaching to components seamlessly.
- **Shader Program Handling**: Simplifies the creation, compilation, and management of OpenGL shader programs with utilities for both vertex and fragment shaders.
- **Texture Management**: Efficiently handles texture creation, binding, and rendering, supporting non-power-of-two textures and various filters.
- **Frame Buffer Operations**: Offers robust methods for working with frame buffers, including reading and writing pixel data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work across major platforms, ensuring consistent behavior and performance.

## Usage

To use `aloe-opengl`, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-opengl = "0.1.0"
```

In your Rust files, you can start using it as follows:

```rust
use aloe_opengl::{OpenGLContext, OpenGLRenderer};

fn main() {
    // Initialize the OpenGL context
    let mut context = OpenGLContext::new();
    // Set up the renderer
    context.set_renderer(Some(Box::new(MyRenderer {})));
    // Attach to a component or window
    context.attach_to(&mut my_component);
    // Run your rendering loop
    context.trigger_repaint();
}

struct MyRenderer;

impl OpenGLRenderer for MyRenderer {
    fn new_open_gl_context_created(&mut self) {
        // Initialize OpenGL resources
    }

    fn render_opengl(&mut self) {
        // Render your scene
    }

    fn open_gl_context_closing(&mut self) {
        // Clean up OpenGL resources
    }
}
```
