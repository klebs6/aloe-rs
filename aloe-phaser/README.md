# Aloe Phaser

Aloe Phaser is a sophisticated 6-stage phaser for Rust that modulates first-order all-pass filters to create dynamic sweeping notches in audio frequency response. It is suitable for digital signal processing applications requiring nuanced audio effects with adjustable parameters.

## Features
- **LFO Rate Control**: Modulate the phaser all-pass filters with an LFO whose speed can be set up to 100 Hz.
- **Depth Adjustment**: Control the volume range of the LFO for precise sound modulation.
- **Centre Frequency**: Set the centre frequency for the phaser's all-pass filter modulation adaptively.
- **Feedback Control**: Adjust feedback volume between -1 and 1 for a wide range of phasing effects, including inversion for unique sounds.
- **Mix Control**: Blend dry and wet signals to achieve the desired audio balance.

## Usage
Integrate Aloe Phaser in your digital audio processing pipeline to harness its phasing capabilities. Customize its parameters using the provided setter functions:

```rust
let mut phaser = Phaser::default();
phaser.set_rate(0.5); // Set LFO rate to 0.5 Hz
phaser.set_depth(0.8); // Set depth to 80%
phaser.set_centre_frequency(1000.0); // Centre frequency at 1000 Hz
phaser.set_feedback(0.5); // Positive feedback
phaser.set_mix(0.5); // Equal mix of dry and wet signals
```

Ensure that your audio processing context meets the required specifications before invoking the phaser's `process` method.

## Implementation Details
Aloe Phaser extends advanced DSP capabilities by leveraging a series of all-pass filters in a cascading configuration. The modulation of these filters by the LFO introduces sweeping notches in the magnitude frequency response, resulting in the characteristic phasing effect.
