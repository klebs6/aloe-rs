# Aloe-ex-assets

Aloe-ex-assets is a versatile Rust library designed to facilitate the parsing and handling of 3D Wavefront OBJ file formats. This crate provides essential utilities for 3D graphics applications, particularly those involving procedural content generation and rendering.

## Features

- **Wavefront OBJ File Parsing**: Contains robust implementations for parsing 3D object models from the common Wavefront .obj format. It includes structures for vertices, texture coordinates, and materials.
- **Material Handling**: Manages materials associated with 3D shapes, including diffuse, ambient, and specular properties.
- **OBJ Shape Representation**: Structures to represent and manipulate 3D shapes and their meshes within an OBJ file.
- **Utility Functions**: Miscellaneous functions for creating color schemes, managing assets, and generating random values.
- **Bouncing Numbers**: Implements numerical oscillators for procedural animations or simulations.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-ex-assets = "0.1.0"
```

### Usage

```rust
use aloe_ex_assets::WavefrontObjFile;

let mut obj_file = WavefrontObjFile::default();
obj_file.load("path/to/model.obj").expect("Failed to load OBJ file");

for shape in &obj_file.shapes {
    println!("Parsed shape: {}", shape.name);
}
```
