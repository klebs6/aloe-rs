# Aloe-AU-Carbon

Aloe-AU-Carbon provides an architectural framework and API for embedding Apple's intelligent Carbon-based user interface components within audio processing units (Audio Units) on Mac OS X. With a focus on compatibility and modular design, the crate allows seamless integration and control of audio parameters via the CAAUParameter structure, encapsulating crucial function types to handle audio events, properties, and controls in the Carbon paradigm.

## Features

- **AUCarbonViewBase**: Defines the primary component for Carbon-based view controls, enabling the creation and management of custom user interfaces tied to specific audio unit instances. Users can create bespoke views using the `create_carbon_view` method, leveraging customizable Float32 points for precise control placement.

- **Event Handling**: Implements comprehensive event handling through the trait `CarbonEventHandlerInterface`, allowing for the registration and management of various event types, fostering responsive and interactive audio interfaces.

- **Parameter Binding**: Through `AUCarbonViewControlInterface`, parameters can be seamlessly bound between the UI and audio unit, maintaining consistency in real-time audio adjustments.

- **AUPropertyControl**: This trait offers functionality to handle property changes and broadcast notifications effectively, ensuring the audio unit states' reflect the desired outputs defined by user interactions.

## Usage

Integrating Aloe-AU-Carbon into your audio unit project is streamlined for developers familiar with UI events in legacy Mac applications. Usage requires:

1. Implementing the `AUCarbonViewBaseInterface` for your custom views.
2. Binding component traits such as `AUCarbonViewControlInterface` to handle parameter-to-control communication robustly.
3. Registering desired events via `CarbonEventHandler`, specifying their `EventTypeSpec`.
4. Controlling dynamic UI updates with precision using methods like `update()` to ensure performance standards.

## Common Terms

- **EventRef**: A reference to Carbon's event instance, central to managing user interaction within the Carbon view framework.
- **ControlRef**: References to specific UI controls, which are manipulated to reflect parameter changes.
- **AudioUnit**: The central audio component, encapsulating processing functions and modifiable properties which the UI manipulates.
