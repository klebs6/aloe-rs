# aloe-documentwindow

## Overview

`aloe-documentwindow` is a Rust crate providing structures and traits for constructing and managing a resizable document window with a customizable title bar that includes minimize, maximize, and close buttons. This crate is essential for developers needing a structured approach to handling GUI window operations efficiently in applications requiring a robust interface for window management.

## Features

- **Customizable Title Bar**: Configure the title bar to include any combination of minimize, maximize, and close buttons.
- **Resizable and Minimizable**: Inherits all functionalities of a resizable window, allowing easy integration into complex applications.
- **Icon and Menu Bar Integration**: Supports an optional icon in the title bar and a menu bar just below it.
- **Event Handling**: Implements listener traits for handling button press events for minimize, maximize, and close operations.

## Usage

First, add `aloe-documentwindow` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-documentwindow = "0.1.0"
```

Implement the required traits and structures in your application:

```rust
use aloe_documentwindow::{DocumentWindow, DocumentWindowTitleBarButtons};

fn main() {
    let mut window = DocumentWindow::new(
        &"My App Window".to_string(),
        Colour::from_rgb(255, 255, 255),
        DocumentWindowTitleBarButtons::allButtons as i32,
        Some(true)
    );
    // Further customize and use the window...
}
```

## Components

### `DocumentWindowTitleBarButtons`
An enumeration that defines the types of buttons that can be displayed on the title bar: `minimiseButton`, `maximiseButton`, `closeButton`, and `allButtons`.

### `DocumentWindow`
A resizable window class featuring a title bar and buttons. The window is designed to be the main frame for your application, with the capacity to handle user interactions via its extensive trait implementations.

### Event Handling Traits
- `CloseButtonPressed`: Implement the event handler for close button actions.
- `MinimiseButtonPressed`: Implement the event handler for minimize button actions.
- `MaximiseButtonPressed`: Implement the event handler for maximize button actions.
