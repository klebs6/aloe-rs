# Aloe VST Platform

Aloe VST Platform is a comprehensive Rust library designed for VST plugin development across multiple operating systems. Providing crucial macros for platform and architecture specific functionalities, this crate simplifies the creation of cross-platform audio processing modules. 

## Overview
This crate exposes an extensive set of macros tied to system-specific capabilities, such as CPU architecture and operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). Constructed with high precision, these macros facilitate efficient interaction with low-level system features, ensuring robust and optimized audio plugin performance.

### Endianness
An enumeration is provided to denote `BigEndian` and `LittleEndian` configurations, ensuring precision in byte manipulation and system-level data management crucial for audio processing.

### Macros
- **CPU-specific Macros:** (`smtg_cpu_x86`, `smtg_cpu_x86_64`, `smtg_cpu_arm`, `smtg_cpu_arm_64`) adjust operations per architecture.
- **Byte Order:** Ensure correct endianess through conditional compilation.
- **Plugin Interface:** Simplifies access to VST APIs facilitating extensive plugin development possibilities.
- **Cross-Language Compatibility:** Macros like `smtg_cpp11` enhance C++ interoperability.

## Usage
Seamlessly integrate the library into your projects by adding it to your `Cargo.toml`. Configure system target features using the corresponding macros:

```rust
#[cfg(target_os="win32")]
#[macro_use]
extern crate aloe_vst_platform;
```

Harness the expanse of capabilities provided by our macros to create versatile, high-performance VST plugins supporting varying system specifications.
