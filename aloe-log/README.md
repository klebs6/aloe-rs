# Aloe Log Crate

## Overview

Aloe Log is a robust and extensible logging framework designed for Rust applications. It provides a straightforward yet versatile interface for application-wide logging, with the ability to implement custom logging strategies and direct log messages to various outputs. 

## Features

### Core Traits and Structures

- **LoggerInterface**: A trait defining the core log handling method, `log_message`, which facilitates the integration of custom logging mechanisms.
- **Logger**: The central logging structure that applications can use to maintain a consistent logging strategy. Offers functionality to set, get, and use custom loggers dynamically.
- **FileLogger**: A straightforward implementation of `LoggerInterface` that writes log messages to a specified file, managing file size and ensuring systematic logging across different platforms.

### Platform-Specific Configurations

- The framework supports various OS-specific debug output mechanisms via the `output_debug_string` method across Unix-like systems, Android, WASM, and more.

### Logging Management

- **set_current_logger**: Assign a new logger implementation at runtime, with safety checks to prevent improper usage.
- **write_to_log**: Directs messages to the currently set logger employing the `log_message` strategy of `LoggerInterface`.
- **File Management**: Includes sophisticated file handling such as truncation for size management and creation of date-stamped logs.

## Usage

To use Aloe Log, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-log = "0.1.0"
```

Implement the `LoggerInterface` if a custom logging output is needed.
```rust
use aloe_log::LoggerInterface;

struct MyCustomLogger;

impl LoggerInterface for MyCustomLogger {
    fn log_message(&mut self, message: &str) {
        // Custom logging logic here
    }
}
```
