# Aloe Colour Crate

Aloe Colour is a powerful Rust library for managing and manipulating colours and gradients in graphics programming. This crate facilitates the creation and application of complex colour gradients, supports detailed ARGB and RGB handling, and incorporates advanced blending and compositing operations essential for high-performance graphics rendering.

## Features

- **ColourPoint**: Represents a point with a specific colour, allowing for position-based colour application.
- **ColourGradient**: Allows the creation of linear and radial colour gradients, facilitating smooth transitions between colours.
- **Colour Representation**: Handles colours with transparency using 8-bit ARGB values, enabling nuanced shading and opacity effects.
- **Pixel Compositing**: Premultiplied alpha handling and pixel compositing operations streamline complex imaging tasks.
- **Colour Transformations**: Supports modification and interpolation of colours based on ARGB and RGB values and includes utilities for HSV/HSL transformations.

## Usage

Integrate Aloe Colour into your project to manage sophisticated colour gradients and enhance your graphic rendering processes. Access various methods to manipulate colours, such as modifying hue, saturation, brightness, and creating lookup tables for gradient interpolation.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_colour::{Colour, ColourGradient, ColourPoint};

// Create Colours
let start_colour = Colour::new_from_rgb(255, 0, 0); // Red
let end_colour = Colour::new_from_rgb(0, 0, 255);   // Blue

// Define Gradient
let gradient = ColourGradient::vertical(start_colour, end_colour, rectangle_area);

// Add intermediate point
gradient.add_colour(0.5, Colour::new_from_rgb(0, 255, 0)); // Green

// Apply Gradient
// Your canvas or drawing logic here...
```

## Advanced Concepts

Aloe Colour supports premultiplied alpha via PixelARGB, which optimizes blending operations by handling transparency at the pixel level, crucial for rendering pipeline efficiency. The HSV and HSL transformation capabilities provide flexibility in adjusting colour properties, ideal for dynamic animations and rich graphical applications.
