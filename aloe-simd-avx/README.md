# Aloe SIMD AVX

The `aloe-simd-avx` crate equips developers with SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities using AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) intrinsics in Rust. Tailored for high-performance computing applications, it efficiently manages multi-data workflows with minimal latency, indispensable for tasks ranging from digital signal processing to complex mathematical computations.

## Overview

Robust AVX intrinsics enable parallel computations over various data types like integers and floating points, with alignment optimizations for efficient memory transactions. Key functionalities include:

- **Data Manipulation:** Load/store operations with specific data alignments.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Efficient vectorized addition, subtraction, multiplication.
- **Logical Operations:** Comprehensive support for bitwise operations and comparisons.

## Structs

### `SimdAvxU64`, `SimdAvxF64`, `SimdAvxI32`
These structs provide core AVX functionalities for unsigned 64-bit, 64-bit floating, and 32-bit signed integers, allowing scalar expansion, vector loads, stores, and element-wise operations.

### Aligned Types
Pre-aligned types such as `FloatAligned` and `Int32Aligned` ensure optimal memory access.

## Companion Utilities
In addition to predefined struct operations, custom functions facilitate vector manipulation and arithmetic processing:

- **`expand`, `load`, `store`**: Simplify handling data within AVX registers.
- **Arithmetic/Logic Operations**: From basics like addition to intricate bitwise evaluations.

## Example Usage
```rust
use aloe::SimdAvxU64;
let data: [u64; 4] = [1,2,3,4];
let vec = SimdAvxU64::load(&data);
let result = SimdAvxU64::add(vec, vec);
```

## Target Audience
Designed for software engineers working on performance-critical applications requiring SIMD operations, particularly those involving massive real-time computations like DSP and scientific simulations.
