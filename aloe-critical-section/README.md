# Aloe Critical Section

Aloe Critical Section is a Rust crate designed for managing thread synchronization through scoped locking using a Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) pattern. It encompasses a suite of generic constructs for safely handling critical sections, ensuring that shared resources are consistently accessed in a thread-safe manner.

## Features

- **Scoped Locking for Critical Sections**: Provides RAII-based constructs like `ScopedLock`, `ScopedUnlock`, and `ScopedTryLock` for automatic locking and unlocking of critical section resources.
- **Generic Template Support**: Utilize `GenericScopedLock`, `GenericScopedUnlock`, and `GenericScopedTryLock` for mutex objects, supporting various locking primitives such as `CriticalSection`, `SpinLock`, etc.
- **Reentrant Mutex**: Supports re-entrant locking through the `CriticalSection` structure.
- **Dummy Critical Section**: Implements a dummy lock, useful for templated systems where locking can be optimized away.

## Usage

A simple usage of `ScopedLock` for a critical section is as follows:

```rust
struct MyObject {
    object_lock: CriticalSection,
}

impl MyObject {
    pub fn foo(&self) {
        let _scoped_lock = ScopedLock::new(&self.object_lock);
        // object_lock is now locked..
        // Thread-safe operations
        // object_lock is unlocked as _scoped_lock goes out of scope
    }
}
```

### Mutex Handling with Generic Scoped Locks

Use `GenericScopedLock` for RAII-based mutex management:

```rust
let critical_section = CriticalSection::new();
{
    let _lock = GenericScopedLock::new(&critical_section);
    // Perform operations with the lock held
}
// Lock released at the end of the block
```
