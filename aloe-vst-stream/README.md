# aloe-vst-stream

`aloe-vst-stream` is a Rust crate that provides an abstraction layer for stream operations aimed at VST plugin development. This crate encapsulates functionalities to read, write, seek, and manipulate binary data streams, facilitating efficient stream handling in memory-constrained environments, particularly in audio processing.

## Features

- **Unified Stream Interface**: It offers a unified interface for binary stream manipulation through traits like `IBStream`, `FStreamerInterface`, and `ISizeableStream`.
- **Memory Management**: Implementations such as `MemoryStream` manage data through dynamic memory allocations, ensuring optimized memory usage.
- **Byte Order Handling**: Supports byte order awareness for reading and writing operations, crucial for maintaining data integrity across different architectures.
- **Flexible Seeking**: Various seek modes (`kIBSeekSet`, `kIBSeekCur`, `kIBSeekEnd`) enable flexible data navigation.
- **Custom Stream Size Management**: `FStreamSizeHolder` aids in tracking and managing stream sizes, allowing for efficient memory utilization and backward compatibility.

## Getting Started

To incorporate `aloe-vst-stream` into your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-vst-stream = "0.1.0"
```

Ensure you have the correct version and license compliance with GPL-3.0.

## Examples

### Basic IBStream Usage
```rust
use aloe_vst_stream::{IBStream, IStreamSeekMode};

fn example_usage(stream: &mut dyn IBStream) {
    let mut buffer = vec![0u8; 128];
    let mut num_bytes_read = 0;
    stream.read(buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *mut _, 128, &mut num_bytes_read);
    // Processed data
}
```

### Memory Stream Management
```rust
use aloe_vst_stream::MemoryStream;

fn setup_memory_stream() {
    let mut memory_stream = MemoryStream::new(std::ptr::null_mut(), 0);
    memory_stream.set_size(1024); // Allocates memory
}
```
