# Aloe Oboe AudioIO

Aloe Oboe AudioIO facilitates audio device management and processing for Android platforms using the Oboe audio library. It provides efficient access to input and output audio channels, enabling seamless integration for high-performance audio applications.

## Features

- **Device Management**: Manage Android audio devices with detailed inspection and configuration of input and output devices.
- **Buffer Management**: Handle audio buffers with automatic conversion between interleaved and non-interleaved formats.
- **High Efficiency**: Designed for low latency and high-performance audio processing with native support for various buffer sizes and sample rates.
- **Session Control**: Start, close, and manage audio sessions with robust error handling and callbacks.
- **Custom Audio Formats**: Support for both `i16` and `f32` audio data formats, with helper functions to convert and refer audio buffers directly to Oboe.

## Quick Start

### Device Info Struct

```rust
pub struct OboeAudioIODeviceTypeDeviceInfo {
    name: String,
    id: i32,
    sample_rates: Vec<i32>,
    num_channels: i32,
}
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
let is_available = is_oboe_available();
console::log!("Oboe Available: {}", is_available);

let mut device = OboeAudioIODevice::new(
    &"DeviceName".to_string(),
    -1, &[], 0,  // For Input
    -1, &[], 0   // For Output
);

let error = device.open(&BigInteger::new(), &BigInteger::new(), 44100.0, 512);
if !error.is_empty() {
    console::log!("Error: {}", error);
} else {
    device.start(&mut my_callback);
}
```

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
