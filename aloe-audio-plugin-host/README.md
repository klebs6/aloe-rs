# Aloe Audio Plugin Host

Aloe Audio Plugin Host is a Rust library designed to identify and interact with various Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software environments. It provides an enumeration of host applications and utility functions to determine the host context in which audio plugins operate.

## Overview

This crate facilitates audio plugin developers in identifying the types of DAWs and software hosts their plugins are being loaded in. This capability is crucial for customizing plugin behavior according to the nuances of each host. Whether you're developing plugins for Ableton Live, Apple Logic, Steinberg Cubase, or other popular DAWs, this library gives you robust tools for host detection.

## Key Features

- **Host Identification**: Enum `PluginHostKind` covers a wide range of DAWs and audio editing software, offering detailed host type recognition.
- **Inter-App Audio Support**: Check Inter-App Audio (IAA) connections on iOS devices to ensure seamless audio routing and integration.
- **Host-Switching Utility**: Switch back to host applications from within standalone plugin environments on iOS.
- **Wrapper Type Detection**: Detects the plugin format that loaded the plugin, aiding in format-specific behavior implementation.
- **Human-Readable Host Descriptions**: Easily fetch readable descriptions to improve user-facing logging and debugging.

## Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_audio_plugin_host::{PluginHostType, PluginHostKind};

let host_type = PluginHostType::default();
if host_type.is_ableton_live() {
    println!("Plugin is hosted in Ableton Live.");
} else if host_type.is_cubase() {
    println!("Plugin is hosted in Steinberg Cubase.");
}
```

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-plugin-host = "0.1.0"
