# Aloe Identifier

Aloe Identifier is a Rust library providing a robust, efficient, and user-friendly mechanism for string-based identifier management. It is designed to facilitate fast comparisons and efficient use of identifiers within various contexts, such as script variables and XML attributes.

## Features

- **O(1) Comparison**: Enable swift equality checks between two identifiers, providing optimal performance in constant time.
- **Customizable Construction**: Create identifiers from strings, raw pointers, or specific character ranges, adhering to allowed pattern constraints.
- **Validation Utility**: Functions to verify identifier validity, ensuring they conform to acceptable alphanumeric, underscore, and special character specifications.
- **Conversion and Integration**: Seamless conversion to and from raw string pointers and standard Rust `String` types.

## Usage

This crate supports extensive operations for creating, managing, and verifying identifiers with ease. Identifiers are primarily designed to be more efficient than strings for repeated operations and are best utilized as static objects when high frequency access is required.

Handling identifiers in environments where only specific character sets are permitted enhances their usability across diverse domains, ensuring they remain valid in system-sensitive contexts.

## Installation

Add `aloe-identifier` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-identifier = "0.1.0"
```

## Examples

```rust
use aloe_identifier::Identifier;

fn main() {
    let id = Identifier::new("example_id");
    assert!(id.is_valid());
    assert_eq!(id.as_str(), "example_id");
}
```
