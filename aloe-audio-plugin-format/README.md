# aloe-audio-plugin-format

Aloe Audio Plugin Format is a Rust library designed to manage and interface with various audio plugin formats, such as VST, AudioUnit, and LADSPA. It provides a structured approach to dealing with these diverse formats through the `AudioPluginFormatManager` and associated classes.

## Features
- **Audio Plugin Management:** Offers a centralized manager to handle different types of audio plugin formats.
- **VST, AudioUnit, and LADSPA Support:** Built-in support for industry-standard plugin types with extensible format compatibility.
- **Plugin Lifecycle Management:** Functions to add, identify, and manipulate plugin formats dynamically.
- **Asynchronous and Synchronous Plugin Creation:** Reliable methods for instantiating plugins efficiently within the application's threading model.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-plugin-format = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

### Create a Plugin Format Manager

```rust
use aloe_audio_plugin_format::AudioPluginFormatManager;

let mut manager = AudioPluginFormatManager::new();
manager.add_default_formats();
```

### Add and Retrieve Plugin Formats

```rust
let num_formats = manager.get_num_formats();
let format = manager.get_format(0);
```

### Asynchronous Plugin Instantiation

```rust
manager.create_plugin_instance_async(description, 44100.0, 512, |instance, error_message| {
    if let Some(plugin) = instance {
        // Handle successful plugin creation
    } else {
        eprintln!("Error: {}", error_message);
    }
});
```
