# Aloe-CD 

Aloe-CD is an advanced library for interfacing with optical drives, specifically focusing on the operations of reading and burning audio CDs. It provides an extensive abstraction over low-level CD operations, allowing efficient disk management and burning processes on multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Features

- **Audio CD Burning**: Offers functionalities to burn tracks to audio CDs with customizability in write speeds and disk operations.
- **Optical Drive Management**: Detects available optical drives, checks disk presence, and manages disk states including tray operations.
- **Audio CD Reading**: Facilitates reading audio CDs as continuous streams, and provides functions to navigate track positions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports operations on major operating systems with specific implementations for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Technical Overview

- **Disk State Management**: The `AudioCDBurnerDiskState` enum classifies the state of the CD drive, enabling state-responsive operations.
- **Burn Progress Monitoring**: Implement the `AudioCDBurnerBurnProgressListener` trait to track and respond to burning progress.
- **Drive Operations**:
  - Find and open optical drives using `find_available_devices` and `open_device`.
  - Control disk states with functions like `get_disk_state`, `is_disk_present`, and `open_tray`.
  - Monitor burning operations with `burn`, `set_buffer_underrun_protection`, and `get_available_write_speeds`.
- **Audio CD Reader**:
  - Navigate and interpret track data using `get_position_of_track_start`, and `get_track_offsets`.
  - Manage disk ejection and track operations with `eject_disk`, `get_num_tracks`, and `refresh_track_lengths`.

## Usage

Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of Aloe-CD for burning an audio CD:

```rust
use aloe_cd::{AudioCDBurner, AudioCDBurnerBurnProgressListener, AudioCDBurnerDiskState};

// Implement a simple progress listener
struct SimpleBurnProgress;
impl AudioCDBurnerBurnProgressListener for SimpleBurnProgress {
    fn audio_cd_burn_progress(&mut self, proportion_complete: f32) -> bool {
        println!("Burn progress: {:.2}%", proportion_complete * 100.0);
        false // Return true to abort burn
    }
}

fn main() {
    let available_devices = AudioCDBurner::find_available_devices();
    if !available_devices.is_empty() {
        if let Some(mut burner) = AudioCDBurner::open_device(available_devices[0]) {
            burner.set_buffer_underrun_protection(true);
            let progress_listener = Box::new(SimpleBurnProgress);
            burner.burn(progress_listener, true, false, 24);
        }
    }
}
```
