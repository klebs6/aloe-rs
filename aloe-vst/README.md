## Overview

Aloe VST is a Rust crate designed for creating and interfacing with Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugins. Leverage the power of Rust's performance and safety to create high-performance audio processing effects and instruments.

## Features
- **Efficient Audio Processing:** Utilize Rust's zero-cost abstractions for real-time audio processing.
- **Flexible Plugin Interfaces:** Design dynamic and versatile plugin interfaces using VST standard.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrate with various DAWs across multiple operating systems.

## Getting Started

```rust
