# Aloe Grid

Aloe Grid is a Rust crate that offers a comprehensive interface for creating and managing grid layouts, akin to the CSS Grid Layout specification. This crate is ideal for developers of user interfaces and graphics applications who seek fine-grained control over component placement and alignment.

## Overview

Aloe Grid provides constructs to define grid layouts using a declarative style. It enables developers to specify the alignment properties, size dimensions, and positioning strategies crucial in contemporary GUI applications. Each component aligns with CSS conventions, facilitating a smooth transition for web developers seeking to leverage Rust's performance.

## Core Features

- **Grid Alignment Enums**: Offers enums like `GridAlignItems` and `GridAlignContent` to define how elements are placed within the grid.

- **Flexible Item Properties**: Utilize structures such as `GridItemProperty` and `GridItemMargin` to control element dimensions, positioning, and margin settings.

- **Track Info and Span**: Leverage `GridTrackInfo` and `GridItemSpan` to detail the grid's row and column configurations.

- **Size Calculations**: Use `GridSizeCalculation` to dynamically compute the grid's dimensions based on its components.

- **Auto-Placement**: Features `GridAutoPlacement` for automated layout adjustments, beneficial for dynamic content scenarios.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-grid = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Basic usage involves instantiating a `Grid`, defining grid items with specific properties, and leveraging the `perform_layout` method to arrange components within a target space.

```rust
use aloe_grid::*;

let mut grid = Grid::default();
let mut item = GridItem::new_with_ref(&mut my_component);
grid.set_gap(GridPx::from(10));  // Set gaps between grid items

// Define the layout and perform layout operation
...
```
