# Aloe Reverb

Aloe Reverb is a high-quality audio processing library written in Rust, providing a versatile implementation of the classic reverb effect for digital signal processing (DSP) applications. This crate is designed to emulate the characteristic reflections and reverberations of real physical spaces, capable of adding depth and texture to audio productions.

## Features

- **Reverb Algorithm**: Implements industry-standard FreeVerb techniques for both stereo and mono audio streams.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Offers comprehensive control over room size, damping, wet/dry mix, width, and freeze mode to achieve the desired sound.
- **DSP Integration**: Ready to integrate with processor chains in digital audio processing setups.
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time audio applications ensuring minimal latency.
- **Concurrency**: Utilizes Rust's ownership and concurrency models for safe audio processing in multithreaded environments.

## Usage

To use the Aloe Reverb crate, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-reverb = "0.1.0"
```

### Sample Code

Here is an example showing how to set up a reverb effect with custom parameters:

```rust
use aloe_reverb::{Reverb, ReverbParameters};

let mut reverb = Reverb::default();

let params = ReverbParameters {
    room_size: 0.8,
    damping: 0.5,
    wet_level: 0.7,
    dry_level: 0.3,
    width: 1.0,
    freeze_mode: 0.0,
};

reverb.set_parameters(&params);
reverb.set_sample_rate(44100.0);

// Process stereo audio signal
// reverb.process_stereo(left, right, num_samples);
```
