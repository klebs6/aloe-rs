# Aloe AU CoreAudio Crate

Aloe-AU-CoreAudio is a sophisticated Rust library specifically engineer for audio handling on macOS and iOS platforms. Leveraging Apple's AudioToolbox framework, it provides robust support for interacting with CoreAudio APIs to manage audio I/O streams, formats, devices, and channel layouts.

## Concepts and Features

### CoreAudio Integration
The crate offers comprehensive bindings and abstractions for working with CoreAudio's AudioChannelLayout and AudioChannelLayoutTag. It enables the conversion between CoreAudio's native layout and Aloe's AudioChannelSet, facilitating operations on various channel configurations without losing fidelity.

### Device Management and Audio IO
Through the provided structured types, such as `CoreAudioIODevice` and `AudioIODeviceCombiner`, users can manage multiple audio devices concurrently, implementing sophisticated I/O operations including read, write, and buffer manipulation.

### Advanced Features
- **Real-time Audio Processing**: Properly synchronizes audio callbacks using high-performance structures like `CriticalSection` and `Atomic`.
- **Sample Rate and Buffer Management**: Dynamically adjusts sample rates and buffer sizes to match device specifications optimally.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Captures and handles various CoreAudio errors gracefully, enhancing application stability.

## Usage

To utilize this crate, include it in your Rust project's `Cargo.toml` as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-coreaudio = "0.1.0"
```

Ensure your build environment is configured for macOS or iOS targets due to dependencies on Apple's CoreAudio APIs.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_au_coreaudio::CoreAudioIODevice;

fn main() {
    let mut device = CoreAudioIODevice::new(/* parameters */);
    device.open(...);
    device.start(...);
    // Process audio...
    device.stop();
}
```
