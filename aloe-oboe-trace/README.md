# aloe-oboe-trace

A powerful Rust crate designed for advanced audio manipulation, tracing, and diagnostics. With robust conversion functions that seamlessly translate between different audio data formats and properties, this crate is ideal for audio engineering and debugging. It offers precise tracing capabilities for system-level insights, enhancing performance monitoring in complex applications.

## Features

- Convert audio data between float and PCM16 formats.
- Retrieve system properties as strings or integers.
- Access SDK and version information.
- Powerful tracing for debugging and diagnostics.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-trace = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_oboe_trace::{oboe_convert_float_to_pcm16, oboe_convert_pcm_16to_float};

// Example: Convert float to PCM16 audio data
let source: [f32; 1024] = [0.0; 1024];
let mut destination: [i16; 1024] = [0; 1024];
oboe_convert_float_to_pcm16(source.as_ptr(), destination.as_mut_ptr(), 1024);

// Example: Begin and end a trace section
let mut trace = Trace::new();
trace.begin_section("Audio Processing");
trace.end_section();
```
