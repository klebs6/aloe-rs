- **Placement Control**: Customize image positioning within a component using `set_image_with_placement` and `set_image_placement` methods.
- **Aspect Ratio Maintenance**: Ensures images are displayed with correct aspect ratios, providing a default centered positioning.
- **Accessibility Support**: Create an accessibility handler with `create_accessibility_handler` to improve user interactions.

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-imagecomponent = "0.1.0"
```

### Example
```rust
use aloe::ImageComponent;
use aloe::RectanglePlacement;

// Initialize a new ImageComponent with a given name.
let mut image_component = ImageComponent::new("MyImageComponent");

// Set an image to display.
image_component.set_image(&my_image);

// Optionally, specify placement.
image_component.set_image_with_placement(&my_image, RectanglePlacement::centred);
```
