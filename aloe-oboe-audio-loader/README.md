# Aloe-Oboe-Audio-Loader

## Overview

Aloe-Oboe-Audio-Loader is a Rust crate designed to dynamically interface with the AAudio API, a robust audio engine introduced in Android, optimizing high-performance audio tasks. This crate facilitates seamless access to audio streams by dynamically linking functions at runtime, therefore maintaining compatibility across Android versions where AAudio API support varies.

## Functional Capabilities

The library aggregates function signatures and dynamically resolves them to interface with the AAudio library. Core functionalities include:

- **AAudioStreamBuilder**: Methods to set parameters such as sample rate, channel count, device ID, buffer size, etc.
- **AAudioStream**: Accessors for stream formats, reads, writes, buffer management, state queries, and more.
- **Dynamic Linking**: Employs `dlsym()` to dynamically resolve function addresses, ensuring backward compatibility by safely handling failures in older Android versions.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Utilizes a singleton pattern to encapsulate the loader's state, maintaining a single instance of the library handle.

## Key Features

- **High-level Abstraction**: Provides a platform-agnostic interface for AAudio API function calls.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful degradation for systems lacking AAudio by failing the linkage safely.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Prevents resource leaks through singleton and appropriate loader cleanup.

## Usage

### Example

```rust
use aloe_oboe_audio_loader::OboeAAudioLoader;

let mut loader = OboeAAudioLoader::get_instance();
if loader.open() == 0 {
    // Successfully opened AAudio library and initialized function pointers.
    // Stream setup and management code goes here.
}
```
