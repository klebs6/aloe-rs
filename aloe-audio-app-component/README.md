# Aloe Audio App Component

Aloe Audio App Component is a Rust library designed for developing audio applications that interface directly with audio input and output devices. It combines audio source management with infrastructural components, serving as a foundational framework for streaming audio applications.

## Overview

The core of this library revolves around the `AudioAppComponent` structure, which acts as a cohesive unit binding together an `AudioDeviceManager`, an `AudioSourcePlayer`, and several configuration utilities. It offers a streamlined interaction model for managing audio streams and device configurations.

### Key Components

- **AudioAppComponent Struct**: Implements essential interfaces for audio applications, allowing easy setup and teardown of audio streams.
- **AudioSource/PrepareToPlayAudioSource Traits**: Facilitate efficient management and processing of audio blocks in an application lifecycle.

### Features

- **Real-Time Audio Processing**: Optimize streaming of audio from native devices using core Rust traits and structures.
- **Custom Device Management**: Integrate your bespoke audio device management logic.
- **Seamless Setup**: Employ `set_audio_channels` for effortless channel configuration.

## Usage

Create a global instance of `AudioAppComponent` and invoke method implementations like `prepare_to_play`, `release_resources`, and `get_next_audio_block` to manage the audio lifecycle. Ensure the audio device setup and interaction adhere to the implementation constraints to avoid runtime assertions.

```rust
let mut audio_component = AudioAppComponent::new(&mut device_manager);
audio_component.set_audio_channels(2, 2, std::ptr::null());
```

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` to include the crate as a dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-app-component = "0.1.0"
```

## Conclusion

The Aloe Audio App Component provides a robust interface for creating audio applications with streamlined interfaces for managing audio devices and channels. It requires careful integration to ensure efficient management of resources and correct device interactions.
