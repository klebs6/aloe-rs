# Aloe-Splash

`aloe-splash` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate the seamless integration of splash screens in your applications. The primary use case for this crate is to display a visual splash screen while your application's initialization processes occur in the background.

## Features
- **Automatic Positioning:** The splash screen automatically positions itself at the center of the display.
- **Auto-deletion:** The splash screen can be configured to auto-delete itself after a specified duration or upon a mouse click.
- **Customizable:** Users can provide custom images, adjust window dimensions, and choose whether to include drop shadows.

## Usage
Create a `SplashScreen` component in the `initialise()` method of your application. Once your initialization tasks are complete, invoke the `delete_after_delay()` method on the `SplashScreen` object to schedule its automatic deletion after a defined period.

### Example
```rust
void MyApp::initialise(const String& commandLine) {
    splash = new SplashScreen("Welcome to my app!",
                            ImageFileFormat::loadFrom(File("/foobar/splash.jpg")),
                            true);
    launchBackgroundInitialisationThread();
}

void MyApp::myInitialisationWorkFinished() {
    splash->deleteAfterDelay(RelativeTime::seconds(4), false);
}
```

## Implementation Details
The `SplashScreen` struct leverages components such as `Timer` and `DeletedAtShutdown` to manage lifecycle events. The splash screen's appearance and behavior are controlled by its `background_image` and `minimum_visible_time` parameters.
