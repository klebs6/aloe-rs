# Aloe Oboe AudioClock

Aloe Oboe AudioClock is an advanced Rust crate designed to facilitate precise audio timing operations. Its primary focus is on stream latency calculation and control over microsecond and nanosecond sleep durations in real-time systems. By providing utilities for accessing high-resolution timing via the `AudioClock` structure, users can schedule, synchronize, and measure audio processing tasks with enhanced accuracy. 

## Features
- **High-Resolution Timing:** Retrieve time in nanoseconds using `get_nanoseconds`, supporting both custom and default clocks.
- **Scheduling:** Utilize `sleep_until_nano_time` to pause execution until a specified real-time point is reached, minimizing drift and delay.
- **Precision Sleep:** Leverage `sleep_for_nanos` for precise control over thread sleep durations.

## API Overview
`AudioClock` struct offers core functionality, targeting applications sensitive to timing drift in audio streams. Applying advanced sleep and timing functions ensures the maintenance of timing accuracy and consistency across diverse platforms.

### Example
```rust
let nanoseconds = AudioClock::get_nanoseconds(Some(42));
AudioClock::sleep_until_nano_time(nanoseconds + 1_000_000, None);
```

This illustrative example demonstrates how to obtain current time and schedule a sleep operation for enhanced stream manipulation.

## Use Cases
Ideal for real-time audio stream processing, timing-sensitive tasks, and precise latency management in sound engineering applications.
