# aloe-au-buffer

`aloe-au-buffer` is a robust library designed for efficient management and manipulation of audio buffer lists in Rust, inspired by the sophisticated handling found in Core Audio frameworks. This crate provides a detailed interface for working with audio data structures, allowing users to manage and process audio buffers with precision.

## Features

- Comprehensive management of buffer lists including allocation, deallocation, and copying of audio data.
- Support for interleaved and non-interleaved buffer formats, emulating flexible memory layouts.
- Inclusion of utility functions for operational safety, such as `safe_multiply_add_uint32` to ensure arithmetic operations do not result in overflow errors.

## Usage

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-buffer = "0.1.0"
```

Import the crate into your project:

```rust
use aloe_au_buffer::{AUBufferList, CoreAudioBufferList, TAUBuffer};
```

Utilize the sophisticated buffer management routines:
```rust
let mut buffer_list = AUBufferList::default();
// Prepare buffer according to a specified format
buffer_list.prepare_buffer(&format, num_frames);
// Securely copy audio data
buffer_list.copy_buffer_contents_to(&mut another_buffer_list);
```

## Safety and Performance Notes
- The library emphasizes safety in buffer operations, ensuring memory is managed correctly through `Drop` implementations.
- Functions are designed to operate efficiently even under demanding audio processing conditions.
