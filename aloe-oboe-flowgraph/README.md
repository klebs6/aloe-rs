# Aloe-Oboe-Flowgraph

Aloe-Oboe-Flowgraph is a Rust crate designed to streamline and enhance the construction, manipulation, and execution of directed flow graphs. By leveraging the capabilities of Rust's type system and performance, this crate provides state-of-the-art utilities for creating complex, reliable flow-based computation models. 

## Features
- **Efficient Flow Construction:** Build and manage directed graphs with optimized performance for both dense and sparse configurations.
- **Type Safety:** Utilize Rust's robust type system to ensure correctness at compile-time.
- **Modular Design:** Components are designed for easy integration and extension, allowing for highly customizable flow solutions.

## Installation
To include Aloe-Oboe-Flowgraph in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-flowgraph = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
Below is a basic example demonstrating how to create a simple flow graph:

```rust
use aloe_oboe_flowgraph::{FlowGraph, Node};

fn main() {
    let mut graph = FlowGraph::new();
    let node1 = graph.add_node(Node::new("Start"));
    let node2 = graph.add_node(Node::new("Process"));
    graph.add_edge(node1, node2);
    graph.execute();
}
```

This would create a flow graph with two nodes and execute the defined flow between them.
