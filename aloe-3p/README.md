# Aloe Deps

Aloe Deps provides a suite of advanced Rust traits and macros for complex systems development including enhanced iterator capabilities, JNI interface operations, and static type assurance.

## Features

- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: Offers comprehensive trait mechanisms such as `GetName`, `HasValueType`, `HasReference`, `HasDifferenceType`, `HasPointer`, and `HasIteratorCategory`, which facilitate sophisticated object manipulation and type representation.

- **JNI Support Macros**: Facilitates Java Native Interface (JNI) class and method creation through extensive pre-defined macros like `declare_jni_class`, `create_jni_method`, and `declare_jni_field`, simplifying integration with Java systems.

- **Static Assertions**: Employ the `static_assert` macro for compile-time validation and error checking across various logical invariants.

- **General Purpose Macros**: Additional macros such as `ternary` and `generic_float_const` provide syntactic sugar for common programming patterns.

- **Wide Character Support**: The `aloe_wchar` type alias provides seamless interoperability with `libc::wchar_t`.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-deps = "0.1.0"
```

Import the desired traits or macros in your Rust code:

```rust
use aloe_3p::GetName;
use aloe_3p::x;
```
