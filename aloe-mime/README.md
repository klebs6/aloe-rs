# aloe-mime

**aloe-mime** is a powerful Rust library designed for retrieving MIME types based on file extensions. It is implemented with efficiency and extensibility in mind, facilitating seamless integration within varied systems requiring MIME type support.

## Overview

MIME types, an acronym for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, are used to specify the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes. `aloe-mime` facilitates this by allowing users to efficiently map file extensions to their respective MIME types using a simple and intuitive API. 

## Features
- **Simple API**: Easily query and retrieve MIME types for given file extensions.
- **Highly Performant**: Leveraging Rust's powerful features, the library is designed for speed and low overhead.
- **Extendable Table**: Customize and expand the list of supported MIME types according to your application needs.

## Usage

Add `aloe-mime` to your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-mime = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use aloe_mime::*;

fn main() {
    let file_extension = String::from("txt");
    let mime_types = get_mime_types_for_file_extension(&file_extension);
    for mime in mime_types {
        println!("{}", mime);
    }
}
```

### Structs
- [`MimeTypeTableEntry`]: Represents an entry within the MIME type table containing a file extension and corresponding MIME type.

### Functions
- [`get_mime_types_for_file_extension`]: Retrieve a vector of MIME types associated with a file extension.

## Extending the MIME Type Table
You can add your custom MIME types by creating new `MimeTypeTableEntry` and managing a custom table.
