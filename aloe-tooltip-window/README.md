# aloe-tooltip-window

Aloe Tooltip Window is a Rust crate designed to manage a pop-up tooltip display within a graphical user interface (GUI). It provides an interface for managing tooltips associated with GUI components, seamlessly enhancing user interactions by offering contextual information.

## Features
- **Efficient Tooltip Management**: Ensures only one tooltip window is instantiated per parent component, preventing clutter from multiple overlapping tooltips.
- **Customizable Display Timing**: Control the delay before a tooltip appears using the `milliseconds_before_tip_appears` parameter.
- **Scalability**: Tooltip windows automatically scale in accordance with their parent component and the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) scaling settings, ensuring consistency across various applications and use-cases.
- **Manual Control**: Provide methods to manually display and hide tooltips at specified locations, allowing for precise design implementations.

## Usage
To integrate `aloe-tooltip-window`, create a single instance of `TooltipWindow`, providing a parent component and an optional delay before tips appear:

```rust
let tooltip_window = TooltipWindow::new(parent_comp, Some(700));
```

- Ensure that no more than one `TooltipWindow` is created with the same parent component to avoid overlapping tooltips.
- Control appearance timing with `set_milliseconds_before_tip_appears` method:

```rust
tooltip_window.set_milliseconds_before_tip_appears(Some(500));
```

- Tooltips are drawn according to the look and feel configurations, which can be customized for appearance consistency across applications.
