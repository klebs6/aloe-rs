  | A class to take care of the logic involved

  | 
  | There's quite a lot of tedious logic
  | involved in writing all the load/save/save-as
  | functions you need for documents that
  | get saved to a file, so this class attempts
  | to abstract most of the boring stuff.
  | 
  | Your subclass should just implement
  | all the pure virtual methods, and you
  | can then use the higher-level public
  | methods to do the load/save dialogs,
  | to warn the user about overwriting files,
  | etc.
  | 
  | The document object keeps track of whether
  | it has changed since it was last saved
  | or loaded, so when you change something,
  | call its changed() method. This will
  | set a flag so it knows it needs saving,
  | and will also broadcast a change message
  | using the
  | 
  | ChangeBroadcaster base class.
