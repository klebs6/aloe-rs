      | Returns a list of all the files that were
      | chosen during the last call to a browse
      | method.
      | 
      | Use this method if you are using the FileChooser
      | on a mobile platform which may return
      | a Url to a remote document. If a local
      | file is chosen then you can convert this
      | file to a Aloe File class via the Url::getLocalFile

      | 
      | This array may be empty if no files were
      | chosen, or can contain multiple entries
      | if multiple files were chosen.
      | 
      | -----------
      | @note
      | 
      | On iOS you must use the returned Url object
      | directly (you are also allowed to copy-
      | or move-construct another Url from
      | the returned Url), rather than just
      | storing the path as a String and then
      | creating a new Url from that
      | 
      | String. This is because the returned
      | Url contains internally a security
      | bookmark that is required to access
      | the files pointed by it. Then, once you
      | stop dealing with the file pointed by
      | the Url, you should dispose that Url
      | object, so that the security bookmark
      | can be released by the system (only a
      | limited number of such URLs is allowed).
      | 
      | @see getResults, Url::getLocalFile
      |
      */
    pub fn get_url_results(&self) -> &[Url] {

    /**
     | Creates a FileChooser.
     | 
     | After creating one of these, use one
     | of the browseFor... methods to display
     | it.
     | 
     | -----------
     | @note
     | 
     | On iOS when saving a file, a user will
     | not be able to change a file name, so it
     | may be a good idea to include at least
     | a valid file name in initialFileOrDirectory.
     | When no filename is found, "Untitled"
     | will be used.
     | 
     | Also, if you pass an already existing
     | file on iOS, that file will be automatically
     | copied to the destination chosen by
     | user and if it can be previewed, its preview
     | will be presented in the dialog too.
     | You will still be able to write into this
     | file copy, since its Url will be returned
     | by getURLResult(). This can be useful
     | when you want to save e.g. an image, so
     | that you can pass a (temporary) file
     | with low quality preview and after the
     | user picks the destination, you can
     | write a high quality image into the copied
     | file. If you create such a temporary
     | file, you need to delete it yourself,
     | once it is not needed anymore.
     | 
     | -----------
     | @param dialogBoxTitle
     | 
     | a text string to display in the dialog
     | box to tell the user what's going on
     | ----------
     | @param initialFileOrDirectory
     | 
     | the file or directory that should be
     | selected when the dialog box opens.
     | If this parameter is set to File(), a
     | sensible default directory will be
     | used instead. When using native dialogs,
     | not all platforms will actually select
     | the file. For example, on macOS, when
     | initialFileOrDirectory is a file,
     | only the parent directory of initialFileOrDirectory
     | will be used as the initial directory
     | of the native file chooser.
     | ----------
     | @param filePatternsAllowed
     | 
     | a set of file patterns to specify which
     | files can be selected - each pattern
     | should be separated by a comma or semi-colon,
     | e.g. "*" or "*.jpg;*.gif". The native
     | MacOS file browser only supports wildcard
     | that specify extensions, so "*.jpg"
     | is OK but "myfilename*" will not work.
     | An empty string means that all files
     | are allowed
     | ----------
     | @param useOSNativeDialogBox
     | 
     | if true, then a native dialog box will
     | be used if possible; if false, then a
     | Aloe-based browser dialog box will
     | always be used
     | ----------
     | @param treatFilePackagesAsDirectories
     | 
     | if true, then the file chooser will allow
     | the selection of files inside packages
     | when invoked on OS X and when using native
     | dialog boxes.
     | ----------
     | @param parentComponent
     | 
     | An optional component which should
     | be the parent for the file chooser. If
     | this is a nullptr then the
     | 
     | FileChooser will be a top-level window.
     | AUv3s on iOS must specify this parameter
     | as opening a top-level window in an AUv3
     | is forbidden due to sandbox restrictions.

      | Returns the last document that was chosen
      | by one of the browseFor methods.
      | 
      | Use this method if you are using the FileChooser
      | on a mobile platform which may return
      | a Url to a remote document. If a local
      | file is chosen then you can convert this
      | file to a Aloe File class via the Url::getLocalFile
      | method.
      | 
      | -----------
      | @note
      | 
      | On iOS you must use the returned Url object
      | directly (you are also allowed to copy-
      | or move-construct another Url from
      | the returned Url), rather than just
      | storing the path as a String and then
      | creating a new Url from that
      | 
      | String. This is because the returned
      | Url contains internally a security
      | bookmark that is required to access
      | the files pointed by it. Then, once you
      | stop dealing with the file pointed by
      | the Url, you should dispose that Url
      | object, so that the security bookmark
      | can be released by the system (only a
      | limited number of such URLs is allowed).
