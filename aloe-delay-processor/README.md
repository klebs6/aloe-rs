# Aloe Delay Processor

The `aloe-delay-processor` crate implements a sophisticated audio processing system for delay effects. It features customizable delay lines with a choice of interpolation methods, allowing refined control over sound manipulation. Specific interpolation methods include NoInterpolation, Linear, Lagrange3rd, and Thiran, each offering distinct audible characteristics. The crate supports high precision float sample processing, utilizing the `FloatSample` trait for generic flexibility.

## Features
- **Direct Delay Processing**: Process audio signals directly using a range of delay line interpolations.
- **Delay Effect Processing**: More complex signal processing with feedback capability, lowpass filtering, and custom mix settings.
- **High precision filtering**: Utilizes FirstOrderTPTFilters and DryWetM mixers for superior sound shaping.
- **Configurable Interpolation**: Choose between multiple interpolation methods for delay lines to suit your audio needs.

## Usage
First, include the crate in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-delay-processor = "0.1.0"
```

Here's a basic example of how you might utilize the `DirectDelayProcessor`:

```rust
use aloe_delay_processor::{DirectDelayProcessor, ProcessSpec};

fn main() {
    let mut processor = DirectDelayProcessor::default();
    let process_spec = ProcessSpec::default(); // Define your process spec as needed

    processor.prepare(&process_spec);
    // Assumed usage in an audio processing context
}
```

Advanced users can configure every aspect of the delay effect by precise management of the delay line specifics and mixer settings. Explore more detailed processing scenarios in the source documentation.
