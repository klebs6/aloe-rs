# Aloe-SIMD

Aloe-SIMD is a Rust crate for leveraging SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions in computational tasks. This crate facilitates high-performance numerical computations by utilizing parallel processing capabilities of modern CPUs, thus enhancing the throughput in data processing applications.

## Features
- Efficiently processes large datasets using SIMD parallelism.
- Optimized for performance-critical applications, providing significant speed-ups in operations involving linear algebra and vectorized computations.
- Designed with an intuitive API for easy integration into existing Rust projects.

## Usage
First, add `aloe-simd` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-simd = "0.1.0"
```

Next, import and use it in your Rust code:

```rust
use aloe_simd::vector_operations;

fn main() {
    let a = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
    let b = vec![4.0, 5.0, 6.0];
    let result = vector_operations::add(&a, &b);
    println!("Result: {:?}", result);
}
```
