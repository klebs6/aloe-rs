# Aloe-Oboe-Flowgraph-Node

Aloe-Oboe-Flowgraph-Node is a Rust crate designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of audio processing flowgraphs. This crate provides a robust and efficient way to handle audio stream processing, featuring a modular node-based architecture.

## Features

- **Node-Based Architecture**: Each node processes audio frames and can be connected via input and output ports, enabling complex audio processing flows.
- **Customizable Processing**: Nodes and ports allow for detailed control over audio data handling and can be customized for specific processing needs.
- **Automatic or Manual Data Flow**: Data can be set to flow automatically through the graph, or manually pulled by calling relevant methods, providing flexibility in processing approaches.

## Key Structures

### `FlowGraphNode`
Represents a basic unit in the flowgraph. Nodes contain input ports and manage the processing of audio data, preventing infinite recursion in cyclic graphs.

### `FlowGraphPortFloat`
Contains a buffer for streaming audio data, allowing connections between nodes to transmit frame data for processing.

### `FlowGraphPortFloatInput` & `FlowGraphPortFloatOutput`
Manage connections and data flow between nodes, ensuring effective data processing and providing interfaces for connecting and disconnecting nodes.

## Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_oboe_flowgraph_node::{FlowGraphNode, FlowGraphPortFloatInput, FlowGraphPortFloatOutput};

let mut node = FlowGraphNode::new();
let mut input_port = FlowGraphPortFloatInput::new(&mut node, 2);
let mut output_port = FlowGraphPortFloatOutput::new(&mut node, 2);

input_port.connect(&mut output_port);

node.set_data_pulled_automatically(false);
node.pull_data(1024, 1);
```
