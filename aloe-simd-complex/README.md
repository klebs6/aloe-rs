# Aloe SIMD Complex

Aloe SIMD Complex is a Rust library for efficient SIMD operations on complex numbers. This crate defines interfaces and implementations to perform high-performance parallel computations using native SIMD instructions, abstracting complex number operations across vectorized data.

## Features

- **Trait-based Expansion**: Leverages trait-based abstractions for expanding scalar values into SIMD vectors and performing operations on them.
- **Complex Multiplication**: Supports vectorized multiplication of complex numbers through SIMD instructions.
- **Native SIMD Operations**: Implements loading, storing, and arithmetic operations efficiently using native SIMD commands, ensuring optimal performance.
- **SIMD Complex Extensions**: Extends native operations to support complex multiplication and summation, crucial for advanced mathematical calculations and physics simulations.

## Usage

To utilize this crate, include it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-simd-complex = "0.1.0"
```

Implement the necessary traits for your data types to leverage the full power of SIMD for complex operations.
