/**
  | A global cache of images that have been
  | loaded from files or memory.
  | 
  | If you're loading an image and may need
  | to use the image in more than one place,
  | this is used to allow the same image to
  | be shared rather than loading multiple
  | copies into memory.
  | 
  | Another advantage is that after images
  | are released, they will be kept in memory
  | for a few seconds before it is actually
  | deleted, so if you're repeatedly loading/deleting
  | the same image, it'll reduce the chances
  | of having to reload it each time.
