# Aloe Image Crate

Aloe Image is a robust Rust crate focused on high-performance image processing and management. It provides an extensive suite of tools for manipulating images in various formats, including JPEG, PNG, and GIF.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Format Support**: Decode and encode images across popular formats like JPEG, PNG, and GIF with specialized traits and structs.
- **Advanced Image Manipulation**: Includes convolution kernels for filtering, color transformations, and pixel operations for detailed image editing.
- **In-Memory and Cached Image Handling**: Efficiently handle images in memory, leveraging caching for performance and resource management.
- **Customizable and Extendable**: Designed with an extensible architecture, allowing integration with custom image formats or operations.

## Detailed Functionality

- **ImagePixelFormat**: Enumerates supported pixel formats, including RGB and ARGB.
- **ImageBitmapDataReadWriteMode**: Defines modes for reading and writing pixel data.
- **Decode and Encode**: Traits like `DecodeImage` and `WriteImageToStream` facilitate reading from and writing to streams, supporting asynchronous operations.
- **ImageCache**: Utilizes a caching mechanism to avoid redundant image loading and optimize memory usage.
- **ImageConvolutionKernel**: Provides tools for applying convolution effects like Gaussian blurs.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Designed with structured handling for various image formats, ensuring efficient resource management and error recovery.

## Technical Overview

This crate is suitable for applications demanding high-quality image processing, including graphics editors, visualization tools, and scientific image analysis. With optimized image operations, Aloe Image enables complex image transformations through Rust's safe and high-performance paradigms.
