# Aloe Oboe Session

Aloe Oboe Session provides an interface to manage audio sessions using the Oboe audio library, specifically enabling Rust developers to handle low-latency audio streams on Android devices. This crate facilitates input and output stream management, supporting latency detection and stream parameter configurations.

## Features
- **Low-Latency Audio Processing**: Seamlessly start, stop, and manage audio streams while detecting input and output latencies.
- **Flexible Sample Format Handling**: Utilize different sample formats, including floating-point and integer samples, depending on device capabilities.
- **Error Handling Mechanisms**: Robust handling of stream errors with automatic recovery features.

## Installation
Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-session = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
This crate provides the `OboeSessionImpl` and `OboeSessionBase` to manage audio streams. Here is a simple example to initialize a session:

```rust
use aloe_oboe_session::{OboeSessionImpl};

fn main() {
    let mut io_device = OboeAudioIODevice::new(); // Assume this is predefined
    let session = OboeSessionImpl::new(
        &mut io_device,
        input_device_id,
        output_device_id,
        num_input_channels,
        num_output_channels,
        sample_rate,
        buffer_size,
    );
    session.start();
    // Your audio processing logic here
    session.stop();
}
```

## API Overview
- `start` / `stop`: Control audio stream lifecycle.
- `get_output_latency_in_samples` / `get_input_latency_in_samples`: Retrieve current stream latencies.
- `on_audio_ready`: Callback processing for audio data.
