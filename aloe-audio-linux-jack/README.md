# aloe-audio-linux-jack

`aloe-audio-linux-jack` is a sophisticated Rust crate that interfaces with the JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK) server for efficient real-time audio processing on Linux systems. It provides an extensive API allowing developers to manage audio input and output devices via JACK, offering fine-grained control over audio data streams.

## Overview

This crate leverages `jack_sys` to provide low-level bindings and introduces a structured interface for creating and managing JACK audio client processes. It facilitates asynchronous communication and low-latency connections required in professional audio processing, fulfilling rigorous demands for audio applications.

### Key Concepts
- **JACK Client and Port Management:** Structure your application using JACK clients and ports for fine-tuned audio routing.
- **Real-time Audio Processing:** Utilize callback mechanisms for processing audio buffers at set intervals.
- **Device and Sample Management:** Manage device scanning, buffer sizes, and sample rates efficiently through optimized Rust data structures.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Audio IO Configuration:** Open, configure, and control audio devices with ease.
- **Dynamic Port Management:** Add or remove audio ports dynamically, adjusting to diverse audio setups.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Integrated error callback functions to handle unexpected server states effectively.

## Usage

Add `aloe-audio-linux-jack` to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-linux-jack = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

Below is a minimal example illustrating how to create a JACK client and a simple audio I/O setup:

```rust
use aloe_audio_linux_jack::{JackAudioIODevice, JackAudioIODeviceType};

fn main() {
    let device_type = JackAudioIODeviceType::default();
    device_type.scan_for_devices();

    let mut device = device_type.create_device("OutputDeviceName", "InputDeviceName");
    if let Some(audio_device) = device {
        // Configure and start your audio device
        let configuration_result = audio_device.open(/* parameters */);
        // Handle sound processing...
    }
}
```

### Testing
The module includes unit tests designed to verify real-time audio processing capabilities. Ensure your JACK server is running before executing tests.
