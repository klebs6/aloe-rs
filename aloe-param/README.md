# aloe-param

**`aloe-param`** is a Rust library designed to facilitate audio parameter management in digital signal processing applications. This crate provides a comprehensive suite of tools for creating and managing normalized audio parameters, enabling the seamless integration of GUI components with audio processors. Through a variety of interfaces, you can manipulate parameters that range from simple boolean switches to complex parameter groups with nested structures.

## Features

- **Audio Parameter Interfaces**: Define flexible audio parameters through traits that support both continuous and discrete values.
- **Parameter Synchronization**: Maintain real-time synchronization between UI components and plugin parameters.
- **Comprehensive Type Support**: Manage various parameter types, including floating point, integer, and boolean.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Create complex parameter groups and support custom UI control attachments.

## Concepts and Usage

- **Normalisable Range**: Employ `NormalisableRange<f32>` for parameter ranges, allowing precise control over value scaling and conversion between UI and internal representations.

- **Attachments**: Utilize `ButtonParameterAttachment`, `SliderParameterAttachment`, and `ComboBoxParameterAttachment` to bind UI components seamlessly to audio parameters.

- **Parameter Groups**: Build structured hierarchies of parameters using `AudioProcessorParameterGroup`, supporting nested subgroups for advanced parameter organization.

### Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_param::{AudioParameterFloat, RangedAudioParameter};

let mut param = AudioParameterFloat::new(
    &"gain",
    &"Gain",
    NormalisableRange::new(0.0, 1.0),
    0.5,
    Some("dB"),
    Some(AudioProcessorParameterCategory::Volume),
    |v, _| format!("{:.2} dB", v),
    |s| s.parse().unwrap_or(0.0),
);
```

This example demonstrates how to create an audio parameter with a normalisable range, suitable for managing gain in a digital audio workstation.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-param = "0.1.0"
```
