# Aloe-Ex-Utilities

Aloe-Ex-Utilities is a comprehensive Rust library focused on providing tools and structures for XML and JSON parsing, asynchronous operations, multi-threading management, and graphical user interface components. Designed for high-performance and scalability, this crate integrates utility modules essential for building robust applications with a focus on handling multi-process interactions, GUI threading, and in-app purchase mechanisms.

## Features

- **XML and JSON Parsing**: Offers intuitive interfaces for parsing and managing XML and JSON data formats with syntax tree traversal and error handling capabilities.
- **Asynchronous and Multithreading Support**: Provides structures like `DemoThreadPoolJob` and `DemoThread` ensuring efficient task scheduling and parallel job execution.
- **GUI Components Integration**: Includes components for building interactive and responsive user interfaces, extending `Component` and `DocumentWindow` base types.
- **In-App Purchase Simulation**: Structures for simulating in-app purchase workflows, with asynchronous notifications and purchase restoration.
- **Multi-process Communication**: Facilitates communication between master and slave processes using message exchange and child process handling.

## Usage

To include Aloe-Ex-Utilities in your project, specify it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-ex-utilities = "0.1.0"
```

## Example

Here's a basic example of how to use Aloe-Ex-Utilities for XML parsing:

```rust
use aloe_ex_utilities::{XMLAndJsonDemoType, XMLandJSONDemo};

fn main() {
    let mut demo = XMLandJSONDemo::default();
    demo.reset(XMLAndJsonDemoType::xml);
    // Interact with demo to parse and view XML data
}
```
