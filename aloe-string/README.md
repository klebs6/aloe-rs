# Aloe-String

Aloe-String is a comprehensive string manipulation library for Rust, providing a set of utilities for internationalized text processing. Blending efficient string storage with powerful operations, Aloe-String caters to string translation, pattern matching, comparison, and memory management.

## Features
- **Locale-Sensitive String Operations**: Dynamically translate strings into localized foreign-language versions using a look-up table.
- **Character Encoding**: Seamless conversion between UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 character encodings.
- **Efficient Storage**: Utilize reference-counted, memory-optimized string storage.
- **Advanced Comparison**: Includes natural, case-insensitive, and whole-word comparisons.
- **Wildcard and Pattern Matching**: Simplifies pattern recognition with basic wildcard support (`*`, `?`).
- **Extensive String Management**: Create, modify, and encode/decode string arrays and pairs.
- **Localization Helpers**: Easily load translation files for multi-language applications.

## Usage

Add this dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-string = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use aloe_string::{AloeString, LocalisedStrings};

let mut greeting = AloeString::new("Hello, world!");
greeting = greeting.to_upper_case();

// Assuming a translation file has been loaded
let translations = LocalisedStrings::new_with_file_contents(&"...content...", true);
let localized_greeting = translations.translate("Hello");
println!("{}", localized_greeting);
```

## Functions & Structs
- `AloeString`: Primary string structure with ref-counted internal representation.
- `StringPairArray`: Holds string key-value pairs for fast lookup.
- `LocalisedStrings`: Singleton class used for handling localization of strings.
- `translate`: Function to translate strings using current localization mappings.

## Configuration
Compile-time configuration options for customizing charset pointers with features such as:
- `ALOE_NATIVE_WCHAR_IS_UTF8`, `ALOE_NATIVE_WCHAR_IS_UTF16`, `ALOE_NATIVE_WCHAR_IS_UTF32`
