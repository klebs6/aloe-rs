# Aloe-ex-app: A JUCE-inspired GUI Application Framework

Aloe-ex-app is a Rust crate that encapsulates a GUI application framework akin to JUCE. The crate provides a set of structures to streamline GUI application development by handling window management and application lifecycle. Its design ethos draws from intuitive object-oriented frameworks, with an emphasis on safety and ease of use.

## Overview

This crate serves as a template for building desktop GUI applications. The primary components are `MainWindow`, `MainComponent`, and `GuiAppApplication`. Each component facilitates specific responsibilities such as window creation, layout management, and application lifecycle events.

### Key Components

- **MainWindow**
  - Implements the desktop window containing an instance of `MainComponent`.
  - Users can redefine `DocumentWindow` methods but with caution to preserve inherited functionalities.

- **MainComponent**
  - Acts as the internal container for GUI controls and content.
  - Hooks for painting operations and layout changes are provided.

- **GuiAppApplication**
  - Represents the core application structure, managing startup, shutdown, and instance behavior.

## Usage

Integrating Aloe-ex-app involves setting up and initializing your application with `GuiAppApplication`. Using Rust's ownership and lifetime features, `MainWindow` and `MainComponent` leverage memory safety and concurrency.

### Example

Below is a rudimentary implementation of a start function:

```rust
fn main(argc: i32, argv: *mut &[u8]) -> i32 {
    // Placeholder for initial functionality
    0 // Return success status
}
```
