# Aloe VST Plugin Client VST

Aloe VST Plugin Client VST is a crate designed for constructing VST audio plugins, enabling seamless integration with digital audio workstations. It leverages the power of the Virtual Studio Technology (VST) SDK to host, manipulate, and control audio processing modules dynamically.

## Features
- Provides rich abstractions for VST plugin capabilities.
- Supports cross-platform functionality, with specialized commands for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and BSD systems.
- Implements robust audio processing routines using both single and double precision to cater to various performance needs.
- Offers comprehensive hosting capabilities for audio processor editors, mimicking native look and feel within host applications.
- Integrates smoothly with Ableton Live, offering host-specific command handling.

## Getting Started
To use this crate, ensure your development environment is set up with the Rust toolchain and VST SDK dependencies. Include `aloe-vst-plugin-client-vst` in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-vst-plugin-client-vst = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage Example
This VST client can be easily integrated into existing audio processing solutions. Define an `AudioProcessor` within your application and pair it with an `AloeVSTWrapper` to interface directly with your host environment:

```rust
use aloe_vst_plugin_client_vst::{AloeVSTWrapper, Vst2AudioMasterCallback};

fn create_plugin(audio_master: Vst2AudioMasterCallback) -> AloeVSTWrapper {
    let processor = create_audio_processor();
    AloeVSTWrapper::new(audio_master, Box::new(processor))
}
```
