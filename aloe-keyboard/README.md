# Aloe Keyboard Crate

Aloe Keyboard is a Rust library that provides a comprehensive abstraction for handling keyboard events and text input management across various platform-specific GUI systems. It is designed to facilitate the creation of robust text editor components by uniformly integrating with on-screen keyboards, OS input mechanisms, and clipboard operations.

## Features

- **Virtual Keyboard Types**: A flexible enumerator detailing possible on-screen keyboard layouts, such as numeric, URL, and text keyboards.
- **Text Input Target Interface**: A trait that standardizes text input management via a unified interface across different text editor components.
- **Key Press Representation**: Implements nuanced key press handling including complex modifier combinations like `CTRL+C` and `SHIFT+ALT+H`.
- **Modifier Keys Management**: Efficient handling and querying of mouse and keyboard modifier states.
- **System Clipboard Access**: Manage clipboard interactions seamlessly for text data.

## Technical Overview

### Virtual Keyboard Type
The `VirtualKeyboardType` enum provides distinct configurations for keyboard layouts suited for specific text input contexts, making it adaptable for different application requirements.

### TextInputTarget Trait
A pivotal trait that components implementing text editing functionality must follow to seamlessly integrate with the library's input system. It includes operations like `is_text_input_active`, managing highlight regions, and determining appropriate keyboard types.

### Modular Design
The `KeyPress` and `ModifierKeys` structs offer extensions for key event handling, supporting advanced operations such as detecting key states in real-time and dynamically constructing key press descriptions.

## Usage Example
Implementing a text editor component with Aloe requires minimal setup. Ensure your component integrates the `TextInputTarget` trait, leveraging Aloe's key event utilities to manage editing commands and input events efficiently.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-keyboard = "0.1.0"
```
