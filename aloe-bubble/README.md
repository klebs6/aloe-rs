# Aloe Bubble Crate

Aloe Bubble provides graphical user interface components that display messages or graphics within speech-bubble-shaped outlines, pointing at locations or components on the screen. It enables developers to utilize visual elements resembling speech bubbles, with customizable placement and automatic timeout functionality, to enhance their application's user interface.

## Features

- **Customizable Placement**: Position bubbles relative to a target with directional options (above, below, left, right).
- **Configurable Timing**: Specify fade-out timing and visibility duration.
- **Event Handling**: Allows bubbles to respond to mouse interactions and manage automatic deletion post-use.
- **Rich Content Support**: Paints complex content within bubbles, supporting multi-line text layouts.

## Usage Example

```rust
let mut bubble_component = BubbleMessageComponent::new(Some(300));
bubble_component.show_at_particular_position(&target_rect, &message_text, 5000, Some(true), Some(false));
```

## Technical Details

- **BubbleComponent**: Acts as a base class drawing and positioning bubble shapes; utilizes subclassing for content rendering.
- **BubbleMessageComponent**: Extends BubbleComponent to include text message rendering.
- **BubblePlacement**: Enum for permitted bubble placements (above, below, left, right).
