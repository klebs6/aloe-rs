# aloe-zip

`aloe-zip` provides a robust implementation of ZIP file handling in Rust, offering both compression and decompression functionalities using the DEFLATE algorithm. The crate supports reading from and writing to ZIP archives, extracting entries to disk, and handling advanced ZIP features such as symbolic links.

This crate utilizes several enumerated types and data structures, such as `GZipDecompressorInputStreamFormat` for input stream formatting and `CodeType` for building decoding tables, to deliver powerful capabilities for managing ZIP files.

The decompression process makes use of multiple inflate modes and configurations, while it efficiently manages memory through a specialized buffering system.

### Features
- Create and modify ZIP files.
- Handle compressed and raw DEFLATE streams.
- Support for symbolic links within ZIP archives.
- Efficiently read from and write to ZIP entries.
- Extensive options for controlling compression with various parameters.

### Usage
Add the dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-zip = "0.1.0"
```

Example:

```rust
use aloe_zip::{ZipFileBuilder, GZIPCompressorOutputStream};

fn main() {
    // Create a new ZIP file builder.
    let mut builder = ZipFileBuilder::default();
    builder.add_file("example.txt", 6, Some("data/example.txt"));

    // Write the ZIP file to a stream or file.
    let output_stream = std::fs::File::create("example.zip").unwrap();
    builder.write_to_stream(output_stream, None).expect("Failed to write ZIP file");

    // Compress data using GZIP
    let mut compressor = GZIPCompressorOutputStream::new(&mut output_stream, None, None);
    compressor.write(b"Hello, world!").unwrap();
}
```
