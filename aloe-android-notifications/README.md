# Aloe Android Notifications

The `aloe-android-notifications` crate provides a robust and sophisticated API for managing and handling push notifications on Android devices. It supports advanced notification features introduced in Android API 26 and above, including badge icon customization, priority settings, lock screen display configurations, and group alert behaviors.

## Features

- **Badge Icon Types:** Customize the appearance of notification badge icons with options for none, small, or large options.
- **Notification Priority and Types:** Set metadata for notifications to fine-tune handling based on priority and use case (e.g., alarm, message, promo, etc.).
- **Timestamp and Visibility Controls:** Determine visibility and format of timestamps on notifications.
- **Lock Screen Appearance:** Adjust how notifications appear when the device is locked.
- **Group Alert Behavior:** Choose sound and vibration behavior for notification groups.

## Usage

Ensure that notifications are correctly set up by downloading `google_services.json` from your Firebase project and configuring your Android exporter paths. Additionally, integrate image and sound resources, and set your app to single-task launch mode if required.

### Example Code

```rust
#[cfg(target_os="android")]
impl PushNotificationsDemo {
    pub fn send_local_notification(&mut self) {
        let mut notification = PushNotifications::Notification::default();
        // Fill the required and optional parameters as necessary
        if notification.is_valid() {
            PushNotifications::getInstance().sendLocalNotification(notification);
        } else {
            // Handle the error
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration

Add the following lines to include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-android-notifications = "0.1.0"
```

Ensure integration in your Android project's manifest and other configurations as outlined in the setup instructions.
