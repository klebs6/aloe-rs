# Aloe Player

A powerful Rust library for handling audio streams in your applications, the **Aloe Player** provides a robust interface for managing audio processing and MIDI input. Developed to work with high-performance audio applications, this crate is indispensable for audio engineers and developers requiring precision in audio playback and processing.

## Features

- **Audio Streaming:** Efficiently stream audio using `AudioProcessorPlayer`, managing input and output channels in a seamless fashion.
- **MIDI Integration:** Process MIDI input for enhanced audio manipulation with precise timing features.
- **Sound Management:** Utilize `SoundPlayer` for playing sounds from files, buffers, or resources with flexible and convenient API.
- **Audio Source Handling:** Handle various audio source types like `AudioBufferSource`, `AudioSourceOwningTransportSource`, and more, with support for looping and position tracking.
- **Thread Safety:** Employ `CriticalSection` locks for thread-safe audio processing.

## Usage

```rust
// Example: Set up an AudioProcessorPlayer
let mut audio_processor = AudioProcessorPlayer::new(Some(true));
audio_processor.set_processor(/* your processor here */);
audio_processor.set_double_precision_processing(true);

// Example: Play a sound from a file
let mut sound_player = SoundPlayer::default();
sound_player.play_from_file(&file_path);
```

## Concepts and Structs

### `AudioProcessorPlayer`
Facilitates real-time audio processing. Implements both `AudioIODeviceCallback` and `MidiInputCallback` letting users integrate seamlessly with devices and MIDI inputs with methods like `audio_device_io_callback`, `set_midi_output`, and precision control using `set_double_precision_processing()`.

### `SoundPlayer`
Highly flexible player for sound buffers, files, and custom audio sources. Offers methods like `play_from_audio_sample_buffer`, `play_resource`, and `play_test_sound` for diverse audio playback requirements.

### `AudioBufferSource`
Outputs an audio buffer with options for looping and cross-channel playback.

## Important Notes
This library assumes a solid background in audio processing principles, a keen understanding of MIDI protocols, and familiarity with Rust's memory management.

This crate is a translation of the JUCE module.

JUCE is a c++ software framework for developing high performance audio applications.

Usage falls under the GPLv3 as well as the JUCE commercial license.

See github.com/juce-framework/JUCE and the JUCE license page for details.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. As such, some of its features may be pending-translation. For progress updates, please see the workspacer rust project. workspacer contains a growing set of utilities designed specifically for rust projects.
