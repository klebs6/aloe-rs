# Aloe VST Thread

Aloe VST Thread is a Rust crate designed for advanced synchronization and locking mechanisms, tailored specifically for VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugin development.

## Key Traits and Structures

### `ILock`
An essential trait providing a locking interface with the following methods:
- `lock(&mut self)`: Engages the lock.
- `unlock(&mut self)`: Disengages the lock.
- `trylock(&mut self) -> bool`: Attempts to engage the lock and returns a boolean indicating success.

### `FConditionalGuard`
A structure responsible for conditionally guarding locks. It attempts to lock only when a valid lock pointer is passed, ensuring safe and efficient resource management.

### `FLockObject`
A reference-counted lock object, crucial for managing resource lifetime and ensuring proper cleanup in multi-threaded environments.

### Platform-Specific Implementations
- **Windows**: Utilizes `CRITSECT`, a critical section object structure tailored for Windows synchronization.
- **POSIX (PThreads)**: Implements mutexes using `pthread_mutex` functions and attributes.
