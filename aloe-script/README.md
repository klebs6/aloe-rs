# Aloe-Script

**Aloe-Script** is a minimalistic JavaScript interpreter designed for embedded scripting capabilities in Rust applications. While it doesn't aim for full ECMAScript compliance or high execution speeds like JIT-compiled engines, Aloe-Script excels in compactness and simplicity, interfacing smoothly with native Rust objects via the `DynamicObject` architecture.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight Interpreter:** Offers basic JavaScript execution without the overhead of larger engines.
- **Native Object Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Rust objects, allowing dynamic interaction between script and host application.
- **Core Arithmetic and Logic Operations:** Supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operations.
- **JSON Support:** Provides functionality to convert JSON text to and from native data structures.
- **Customizable Execution:** Set maximum execution times to prevent runaway scripts.

## Usage

1. **Initialization:** Instantiate a `JavascriptEngine` and register any necessary native objects.

   ```rust
   let mut engine = JavascriptEngine::default();
   engine.register_native_object("myObject", &mut my_dynamic_object);
   ```

2. **Script Execution:** Execute JavaScript code with the `execute()` method and retrieve results with `evaluate()`.

   ```rust
   engine.execute(&"console.log('Hello, Aloe-Script!')".to_string());
   let result = engine.evaluate(&"2 + 2".to_string(), &mut None);
   ```

3. **Native Function Calls:** Directly call functions within the script environment using `call_function()`.

   ```rust
   let return_val = engine.call_function("myFunction", &args, &mut None);
   ```

## Considerations

- **Reference Counting:** Uses reference counting instead of garbage collection, which can lead to cyclic dependency issues.
- **Performance:** Not intended for heavy computational tasks; best suited for lightweight scripting requirements.

## Requirements

- **Rust 2024 Edition**
