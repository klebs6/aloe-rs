# Aloe Table Crate

`aloe-table` is a Rust crate that facilitates the creation of dynamic and customizable tables within a graphical user interface (GUI). It provides a robust structure for handling table interactions such as column resizing, moving, sorting, and cell manipulation. This crate is particularly useful for applications requiring a dynamic display of tabulated data, with support for user interactions and custom rendering.

## Features

- **Table Interaction**: Respond to column resizing, movement, and sorting through a comprehensive set of traits.
- **Custom Rendering**: Implement your own cell and row rendering logic using the `TableListBoxModel` trait.
- **Event Management**: Register and manage event listeners for table header changes.
- **Accessibility**: Includes support for accessibility features, ensuring your tables are usable for all users.

## Technical Overview

### Key Concepts

- **TableHeaderComponent**: Manages column headers, allowing them to be resized and reordered by users.
- **TableListBox**: Acts as the main container for rows and columns, relying on a data model defined by `TableListBoxModel`.
- **Event Listeners**: Implement various traits like `TableHeaderComponentListener` to handle events triggered by user interactions with the table.
- **Rendering and Updating**: Override methods to customize the painting of cells and headers, and handle the updating of components for dynamic data.

### Usage Example

To get started with `aloe-table`, implement the `TableListBoxModel` trait, providing logic for how your data should be rendered in the table cells. Register a `TableHeaderComponentListener` to respond to user interactions such as column sorting or resizing. Below is a simplified example of setting up a table:

```rust
use aloe_table::{TableListBox, TableListBoxModel, TableHeaderComponent};

struct MyTableModel;

impl TableListBoxModel for MyTableModel {
    // Implement required methods for handling table data
}

fn main() {
    let table_list_box = TableListBox::new(Some("My Table"), &mut MyTableModel);
    let header = TableHeaderComponent::default();
    table_list_box.set_header(Box::new(header));
    // Additional setup...
}
```

## Installation

To use `aloe-table` in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-table = "0.1.0"
```
