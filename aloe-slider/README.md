# Aloe Slider

Aloe Slider is a versatile and extensible slider component built in Rust for graphical user interfaces. Designed to cater to various styling needs, the component accommodates multiple slider types, including linear, rotary, and inc-dec buttons, along with customizable text box positions for displaying slider values.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Slider Styles**: From linear to rotary and inc-dec buttons, customize your slider to suit horizontal, vertical, or dynamic application paths.
- **Text Box Entries**: Position the slider's text entry box flexibly around or within the slider itself, providing ease of interaction for numeric value adjustments.
- **Listener Support**: Register listeners for real-time updates on slider movements and value changes.
- **Custom Look and Feel**: Implement custom rendering for enhanced visual distinction while relying on predefined `LookAndFeel` interfaces or crafting your own.
- **Color Customization**: Change the color of various slider components, including track, thumb, and text boxes, ensuring a coherent user experience.

## Usage Example
Here's a basic usage example to implement a linear slider:

```rust
use aloe_slider::{Slider, SliderStyle, SliderTextEntryBoxPosition};

fn main() {
    let mut slider = Slider::default();
    slider.set_slider_style(SliderStyle::LinearHorizontal);
    slider.set_text_box_style(SliderTextEntryBoxPosition::TextBoxBelow, false, 100, 20);
}
```
