# Aloe MultiDoc

Aloe MultiDoc is a Rust-based library designed to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) framework for managing multiple documents within a single application window. The core functionality revolves around the `MultiDocumentPanel` component, which can be utilized to administer an arbitrary number of documents, organized either in floating windows or as tabs, depending on user preference.

## Features

- **Flexible Document Layouts**: Users can switch between floating windows and tabbed interfaces, catering to different use cases and visual preferences.
- **Asynchronous Document Operations**: Designed with modern applications in mind, offering asynchronous handling for closing documents to prevent UI freezes.
- **Customizable Components**: Offers extensibility by allowing new document windows to be easily created and managed.
- **Automatic Resource Management**: Manages memory and resources efficiently by internally handling component destruction based on the configuration.

## Usage

To use Aloe MultiDoc, integrate the crate into your project and instantiate a `MultiDocumentPanel`. Add documents to the panel using `add_document()`, specify their layout mode via `set_layout_mode()`, and manage their lifecycle with `close_document()` or `close_document_async()` methods.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_multidoc::{MultiDocumentPanel, MultiDocumentPanelLayoutMode};

fn main() {
    let mut panel = MultiDocumentPanel::default();
    panel.set_layout_mode(MultiDocumentPanelLayoutMode::FloatingWindows);
    // Add documents to the panel and manage them...
}
```
