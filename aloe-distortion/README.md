# Aloe Distortion

Aloe Distortion is a Rust audio processing library designed to simulate an overdrive effect. It provides audio developers with efficient and customizable components for creating audio distortion and enhancing sound dynamics using oversampling and wave shaping. Designed with flexibility, this crate is compatible with a variety of audio processing tasks, bolstered by its components that facilitate the creation of realistic overdrive sound signatures.

## Features

- **Modular Components:** Leverage modular components like `OverdriveGainProcessor`, `OverdriveBiasProcessor`, and `OverdriveDriveProcessor` for nuanced overdrive effects.
- **Processor Chains:** Effortlessly build audio chains with `ProcessorChain`, equipped for complex audio transformations.
- **Comprehensive Oversampling:** Utilize six levels of oversampling for high-fidelity audio processing.
- **Wave Shaping & Clipping:** Integrate different wave shaping methods to model distortion with precision and safely handle signal clipping.

## Usage

Integrate Aloe Distortion in your project by adding it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-distortion = "0.1.0"
```

## Example

```rust
use aloe_distortion::{DistortionProcessor};

fn main() {
    let mut processor = DistortionProcessor::default();
    // Configure processor specifics, then prepare context and initiate processing
}
```
