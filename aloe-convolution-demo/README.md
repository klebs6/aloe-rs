# Aloe Convolution Demo

Aloe Convolution Demo is a Rust crate designed for audio signal processing, specifically convolution operations which are pivotal in digital signal processing used in audio effects, reverberation, and emulations of acoustic spaces. It provides an efficient and flexible structure to load impulse responses and apply them to audio data streams.

## Crate Functionality

The primary structs in this library are `ConvolutionDemo` and `ConvolutionDemoDSP`. These functionalities include:

- **ConvolutionDemo**: Manages audio file input and GUI components.
- **ConvolutionDemoDSP**: Handles digital signal processing, preparing and processing the audio signal contexts, and enabling bypass operation.

## Key Components

- **AudioFileReaderComponent**: Reads audio data from files to supply them to the convolution processor.
- **MemoryBlock and BufferTransfer**: Utilities for managing audio data buffers needed to process convolution operations efficiently.
- **Convolution**: The core processing engine that applies impulse responses to input audio data.
- **ChoiceParameter**: Helps manage user-selectable parameters, such as choosing cabinets for guitar amp simulation.

## Usage

The typical usage involves preparing the DSP component with specific processing specifications, managing audio file reading, and configuring the convolution engine to respond to real-time signal processing commands:

- **Prepare and Process**: Modify the sample rate and load impulse responses efficiently to apply convolution effects accurately.
- **Reset and Parameter Updates**: Handle changes in configurations dynamically, enabling seamless transition and update of DSP operation parameters.

## Installation

Include the following in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-convolution-demo = "0.1.0"
```
