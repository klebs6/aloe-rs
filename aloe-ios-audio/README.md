# Aloe iOS Audio Crate

**Aloe iOS Audio** provides a sophisticated audio interface for iOS applications using Rust. Leveraging Apple's AVAudioSession and Core Audio frameworks, it encapsulates comprehensive functionalities to manage audio input/output devices, facilitating robust audio processing in iOS applications.

## Features

- **Audio Session Management:** Seamlessly handle AVAudioSession configurations, route changes, and error logging to optimize audio performance.
- **Audio Device Handling:** Support for multiple audio devices with configurable input/output channels.
- **Flexible Sample Rate and Buffer Size:** Optimize audio quality by dynamically adjusting sample rates and buffer sizes.
- **Inter-App Audio:** Includes features for managing inter-app audio connections, supporting both audio streaming and MIDI message handling.
- **Error Handling:** Provides diagnostic logging capabilities, enhancing debugging and live monitoring of audio status changes.

## Structs and Types

- **iOSAudioIODevice:** Main audio device abstraction, encapsulating device operations and configuration.
- **IOChannelData:** Manages audio channel data for input/output operations, ensuring data integrity and transfer.
- **AudioSessionHolder:** Captures session-level information and facilitates the lifecycle of audio device connections.

## Usage

To use this crate, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-ios-audio = "0.1.0"
```

```rust
use aloe_ios_audio::{iOSAudioIODevice, IOChannelData};

// Initialize and configure an audio device
let mut audio_device = iOSAudioIODevice::default();

// Open the audio device with desired configurations
let result = audio_device.open(&input_channels, &output_channels, sample_rate, buffer_size);

if result.is_empty() {
    // Start processing audio
    audio_device.start(callback);
    // Get available sample rates and buffer sizes
    let sample_rates = audio_device.get_available_sample_rates();
    let buffer_sizes = audio_device.get_available_buffer_sizes();

    // Perform audio operations...

    // Stop and close the device when done
    audio_device.stop();
    audio_device.close();
} else {
    eprintln!("Failed to open audio device: {}", result);
}
```
