# Aloe Oboe FlowGraph Filter

**Aloe Oboe FlowGraph Filter** is a Rust crate designed for advanced audio processing applications. It provides a structured framework for creating audio processing nodes capable of converting input streams into modified output streams with equal channel dimensions. This includes, but is not limited to, filters such as FIR, as well as nodes facilitating audio data conversion, format conversion, channel manipulation, and sample rate transformation.

## Features

- **Flow Graph Filtering**: Base class for nodes with equivalent input and output channel configurations.
- **AudioStream Wrapping and Conversion**: Encompasses operations like channel and data format conversions.
- **Adaptive Rate Scaling**: Facilitates smooth audio transformations by dynamically adjusting to differing sample rates.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling and Callback Support**: Interfaces for stream error and data callback management.
- **Flexible Asynchronous Operations**: Methods to start, pause, flush, and stop streams asynchronously, supporting non-blocking audio applications.

## Usage

Below is a basic example of how to initialize a `FlowGraphFilter`:

```rust
use aloe_oboe_flowgraph_filter::FlowGraphFilter;

let filter = FlowGraphFilter::new(2); // Initialize with 2 channels
```

### Setting Up a FilterAudioStream

```rust
use aloe_oboe_flowgraph_filter::FilterAudioStream;

fn setup_audio_stream(builder: &AudioStreamBuilder, child_stream: *mut AudioStream) -> FilterAudioStream {
    let filter_audio_stream = FilterAudioStream::new(builder, child_stream);
    // Proceed with configuration...
    filter_audio_stream
}
```

## Documentation

The crate follows a well-defined flowgraph architecture for audio signal processing. Each node in the flowgraph is tasked with specific conversion operations be it data type, channel adjustments, or sample rate matching.
