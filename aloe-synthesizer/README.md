# Aloe Synthesizer

Aloe Synthesizer is a comprehensive Rust library for simulating polyphonic sound synthesis. This crate allows the creation of sophisticated audio synthesis mechanisms using virtual instruments capable of playing sounds through MIDI note inputs. Leverage the power of Rust to produce harmonious audio renderings and simplify the development of software synthesizers.

### Features

- **SynthesizerSound**: Define how specific MIDI notes and channels activate particular sounds.
- **SynthesizerVoice**: Manages individual notes being played, allowing instantaneous and simultaneous note handling.
- **Comprehensive Audio Processing**: Efficiently handle MIDI inputs and produce smooth, high-quality audio output.
- **Dynamic Voice Allocation**: Ability to add, remove, or retrieve sounds and voices dynamically.

### Technical Details

A synth consists of multiple sounds and voices. Each `SynthesizerSound` describes the musical element, while a `SynthesizerVoice` is responsible for rendering the audio output. This design enables multiple voices to play the same sound concurrently, facilitating polyphonic sound production.

The `SynthAudioSource` is the central audio source managing MIDI events and synthesizer voices to produce audio content.

### Usage

Start by implementing the `SynthesizerSound` to define sounds. Create a subclass of `SynthesizerVoice` for your sound rendering logic, then instantiate a `Synthesizer` and populate it with your voices and sounds.

```rust
let mut synth = Synthesizer::default();
let sound = SineWaveSound::default();
synth.add_sound(&Rc::new(RefCell::new(sound)));
```

### Getting Started

To integrate Aloe Synthesizer into your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-synthesizer = "0.1.0"
```

This crate is a translation of the JUCE module.

JUCE is a c++ software framework for developing high performance audio applications.

Usage falls under the GPLv3 as well as the JUCE commercial license.

See github.com/juce-framework/JUCE and the JUCE license page for details.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. As such, some of its features may be pending-translation. For progress updates, please see the workspacer rust project. workspacer contains a growing set of utilities designed specifically for rust projects.
