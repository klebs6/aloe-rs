# aloe-au-parameter

Aloe-au-parameter is a Rust crate designed for the complex manipulation and management of audio unit parameters, facilitating dynamic parameter mapping and localized representation. The library is specifically implemented to handle both constant and ramped parameter values efficiently, providing comprehensive control over audio unit parameter specifications.

## Overview
This crate encapsulates two primary structures: `ParameterMapEvent` and `CAAUParameter`, each equipped with methods to enable nuanced interaction with audio unit parameters. The former structure is geared towards representing a parameter's value, either constant or ramped over time, while the latter serves as a complete parameter specification.

### ParameterMapEvent

The `ParameterMapEvent` structure allows for the creation and management of both immediate and scheduled audio unit parameter events. It supports various operations such as setting scheduled events, retrieving event types, and interpolating values over ramps within processing slices.

### CAAUParameter

`CAAUParameter` offers a detailed specification for audio unit parameters, including options for initialization, name tagging, and display transformation. It supports retrieving and setting parameter values, along with optional string representations for parameter values and descriptive tags.

## Key Functions
- `create_localized_string_for_parameter_value`: Generates a human-readable, localized string representation of a parameter value.
- `value_for_localized_parameter_string`: Converts a localized string back into a numerical parameter value.
- `create_localized_string_for_parameter_value_with_min_digits`: Allows additional control over digit formatting in parameter string representation.

## Usage
A detailed understanding of audio signal processing and parameter management in the context of digital audio workstations would be advantageous when utilizing this crate. Users can define precise audio unit behaviors and conversions between parameter forms, tailored to their needs.
