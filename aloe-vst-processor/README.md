# aloe-vst-processor

Aloe VST Processor is an intricate Rust-based library tailored for VST3 audio plugin development. This crate provides an extensive suite of enums, traits, and structs to embody the robust VST3 protocol, emphasizing audio processing and component management for audio plugins in digital audio workstations (DAWs).

## Key Components

- **FrameRateFlags**: Encapsulates frame rate properties critical for synchronizing audio and visual components.

- **ChordMasks**: Defines musical chords' representation within the processing context.

- **ComponentFlags**: Outlines flags for component characteristics and capabilities in audio processing environments.

- **SymbolicSampleSizes**: Describes sample size resolution, determining processing granularity.

- **ProcessContextStatesAndFlags**: Manages the context state, indicating system and project timing validity, tempo, and synchronization states.

- **ProcessModes**: Explains modes such as Realtime, Prefetch, and Offline, guiding the plug-in processing behavior under various operational scenarios.

- **IAudioProcessor**: The primary interface which audio processing plugins must implement to manage their audio streams and processing setups efficiently.

## Usage

This crate is designed for experienced developers engaged in audio processing and plugin development. Implement `IAudioProcessor` to create custom audio processing paradigms and utilize the variety of utilities provided to handle intricate timing, sample handling, and audio data manipulation.
