# Aloe Audio Processor Graph Crate

Aloe is a comprehensive audio processing graph library in Rust, designed for creating intricate audio processing networks. With support for handling various audio and MIDI input and output nodes, it enables advanced music applications and digital signal processing tasks on audio streams with precision and console-style chain operations in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Graph-Based Audio Processing**: Construct versatile audio processing structures with nodes representing individual processors and connections defining data flow.
- **Input/Output Processing**: Versatile support for audio and MIDI input/output nodes for comprehensive audio signal management.
- **Flexible Buffer Management**: Advanced management of audio and MIDI buffers, supporting efficient rendering and mixing jobs.
- **Double Precision Processing**: Sophisticated support for processing large audio streams using single and double precision models.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-processor-graph = "0.1.0"
```

### Usage
Here's a basic setup to illustrate the implementation of a simple audio processor graph:
```rust
use aloe_audio_processor_graph::{AudioProcessorGraph, AudioGraphIOProcessorIODeviceType};

fn main() {
    let mut graph = AudioProcessorGraph::default();
    let input_node_id = graph.add_node(AudioGraphIOProcessorIODeviceType::audioInputNode);
    let output_node_id = graph.add_node(AudioGraphIOProcessorIODeviceType::audioOutputNode);

    graph.add_connection(input_node_id, 0, output_node_id, 0).expect("Failed to connect nodes");
    
    graph.prepare_to_play(44100.0, 256);
    // Perform audio processing based on the graph setup
}
```
