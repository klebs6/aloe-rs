# Aloe-MP3

Aloe-MP3 is a sophisticated Rust library designed for software-based MP3 decoding. It is capable of processing MP3 audio streams by parsing frames, handling variable bit rate (VBR) data, and interfacing with the LAME encoder for encoding tasks.

## Overview
Aloe-MP3 is intended for use in professional audio applications where precision and compliance with MP3 specifications are paramount. Users should be aware of the legal implications related to MP3 patents and ensure compliance with their jurisdiction. This crate offers a comprehensive suite of structures and functions for decoding MP3 audio data, enabling audio analysis, manipulation, and encoding via LAME.

## Features
- **MP3 Frame Decoding:** Utilize the `MP3AudioFormat` structure for frame decoding with detailed MP3 stream parsing.
- **VBR Support:** Decode and interpret variable bit rate tags using `Mp3DecoderVBRTagData`.
- **LAME Encoder Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with the LAME encoder through `LameEncoderAudioFormatWriter` for enhanced audio format writing capabilities.
- **Advanced DSP:** Employ functions such as `mp3_decoder_dct36` and `mp3_decoder_dct12` for spectral transformations.

## Usage
To use Aloe-MP3 in your project, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-mp3 = "0.1.0"
```

### Example
```rust
use aloe_mp3::MP3AudioFormat;

fn main() {
    let mut format = MP3AudioFormat::default();
    // Further decoding and processing code here
}
```

## Important Notes
- **Disclaimer:** Users must independently verify the legal implications of using this code in their respective territories.
- **Configuration:** Enabling the `ALOE_USE_MP3AUDIOFORMAT` flag invokes the MP3 decoder at your own risk, agreeing to indemnify Raw Material Software Limited against any legal challenges.
