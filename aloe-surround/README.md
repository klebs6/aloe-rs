# Aloe Surround

Aloe Surround is a sophisticated Rust crate tailored for the creation and manipulation of multi-channel audio processing systems. It provides a robust framework for managing audio channels, supporting complex audio channel layouts, and delivering advanced audio processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Channel Management**: Handle dynamic audio channels with the ability to activate or deactivate individual channels and update channel layouts.
- **Audio Processing**: Utilize a comprehensive suite of functions to manage audio processing tasks, such as preparing for playback and handling the audio processing cycle.
- **Graphical Interface**: Integrate with GUI components for real-time adjustments and visualization of audio channels.
- **Async Updater**: Includes asynchronous capabilities for efficient real-time processing without blocking the main audio thread.

## Core Structures

### `SurroundProcessor`

Acts as the central processing unit for multi-channel audio. It allows for channel button event handling, processing audio buffers, and managing active channels through asynchronous updates.

#### Key Functions:

- `prepare_to_play`: Initialize the processor to handle audio samples efficiently by preparing the internal state.
- `process_block`: Process blocks of audio data, applying custom algorithms to maintain channel states and generate signals.

### `SurroundEditor`

Facilitates the configuration and graphical representation of audio channels. It manages channel layouts and interactive controls for users to update and visualize their audio configurations.

#### Key Functions:

- `updategui`: Refresh the graphical interface with current channel active states.
- `paint`: Render the background elements and GUI components.

## Usage

To utilize Aloe Surround, ensure integration with your Rust project by including it in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-surround = "0.1.0"
```

Implement `ChannelClickListener` in your applicative context and utilize `SurroundProcessor` and `SurroundEditor` for seamless audio channel management.
