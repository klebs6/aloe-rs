# Aloe Audio Processor Value Tree

**Aloe Audio Processor Value Tree** is a Rust crate that offers a comprehensive framework for managing audio processor state through a value tree architecture. It facilitates the synchronization and control of audio parameters using a clear and modular structure, allowing for grouped parameter management and seamless integration with GUI components.

## Overview

The core concept revolves around mapping audio parameters to a hierarchical `ValueTree`, enabling extensive control over the processor's state. The crate provides robust abstractions for creating, managing, and attaching parameters in an efficient manner. It exposes interfaces to register listeners for parameter changes and update the underlying `ValueTree` accordingly.

## Key Features

- **Parameter Management:** Organize `RangedAudioParameters` in hierarchical `AudioProcessorParameterGroups`, facilitating batch management.
- **GUI Integrations:** Connect parameters directly to GUI components such as sliders and buttons, ensuring real-time synchronization.
- **Undo/Redo Support:** Leverage optional undo management for comprehensive state control.
- **State Serialization:** Easily clone and replace state trees for seamless state management across threads.

## Usage

Implementations include:

- `AudioProcessorValueTreeState`: Central entity managing parameter states for an audio processor.
- `AudioProcessorValueTreeStateParameter`: Facilitates creation and handling of parameters with metadata support.
- **Attachment Classes**: Seamlessly connect GUI components with parameters to reflect dynamic state changes.

```rust
use aloe_audio_processor_value_tree::*;

let mut processor = AudioProcessor::new();
let undo_manager = UndoManager::new();
let parameter_layout = AudioProcessorValueTreeStateParameterLayout::default();
let apvts = AudioProcessorValueTreeState::new_with_parameter_layout(&mut processor, &undo_manager, "PARAMETERS", parameter_layout);
```

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-processor-value-tree = "0.1.0"
```
