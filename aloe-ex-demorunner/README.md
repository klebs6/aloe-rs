# Aloe Ex Demorunner

A sophisticated Rust library, `aloe-ex-demorunner`, designed for advanced users interested in executing and rendering various demos including 3D, audio, and GUI components. The crate encapsulates a rich set of types, each provided with specific functionalities suited for demonstration and visualization purposes using Wavefront OBJ files, 3D graphics rendering, and audio visualization.

## Key Features
- **Wavefront OBJ File Support**: Classes like `WavefrontObjFile` parse and manage 3D model data.
- **Audio Processing**: Components such as `LiveScrollingAudioDisplay` interact with audio inputs, providing real-time waveform visualization.
- **Rich GUI Renderings**: The `MainAppWindow` and `TabbedComponent` provide infrastructural support for rendering demos and interfacing with system graphical environments.
- **System Tray Interaction**: Integrates system-specific functionalities through `DemoTaskbarComponent`.

## Getting Started
To utilize this crate, import `aloe-ex-demorunner` within your Rust project manifest. Ensure your environment is set up with necessary dependencies and compilers for GUI and multi-platform support.

```rust
// In your main.rs
extern crate aloe_ex_demorunner;
use aloe_ex_demorunner::*;
```

### Sample Usage

```rust
let mut wavefront_obj = WavefrontObjFile::default();
wavefront_obj.load_from_file("path/to/model.obj").unwrap();
// Usage continues with the application demo components...
```

## Modules Overview
### Demo Rendering
- `MainComponent` and `DemoContentComponent` are for managing demo states and rendering.
- `IntroScreen` and `SidePanel` provide the UI interface.

### Audio and Visual
- `LiveScrollingAudioDisplay` manages real-time audio processing.

### File Parsing
- `WavefrontObjFile` for parsing 3D models with associated materials and geometries.
