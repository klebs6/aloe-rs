# aloe-oboe-no-aaudio

A comprehensive Rust crate designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between the AAudio interface and Rust applications. It provides type definitions directly mapped from AAudio's C header files for efficient audio stream management on Android.

## Overview
The crate includes essential type definitions required for constructing and manipulating audio streams using the AAudio API on Android platforms. It's an indispensable tool for developers dealing with audio stream configurations, data callbacks, and error handling within the AAudio context.

## Usage
To leverage the AAudio API in your Rust application and manage intricate details of audio streaming, do the following:

```rust
use aloe_oboe_no_aaudio::*;

// Define your AAudio stream callback
fn my_data_callback(
    stream: *mut AAudioStream, 
    user_data: *mut c_void, 
    audio_data: *mut c_void, 
    num_frames: i32
) -> AAudioDataCallbackResult {
    // Your audio data processing logic
}

// Handle stream errors
fn my_error_callback(
    stream: *mut AAudioStream, 
    user_data: *mut c_void, 
    error: AAudioResult
) {
    // Your error handling logic
}
```

## Features
- **Comprehensive Type Definitions**: Includes all major AAudio types like `AAudioStream`, `AAudioStreamBuilder`, and `AAudioStreamState`.
- **Callback Management**: Simplifies the integration of custom data and error callbacks for audio streams.
- **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Ensures smooth operation with native Android AAudio features.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-no-aaudio = "0.1.0"
```
