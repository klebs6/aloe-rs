# aloe-oboe-flowgraph-sink

Aloe Oboe Flowgraph Sink is a Rust crate designed to facilitate audio data consumption within a flowgraph processing architecture. The crate provides various audio sink structures for reading audio data, supporting multiple sample formats efficiently, thereby optimizing audio processing pipelines.

## Overview

This crate features a series of `FlowGraphSink` structures, each equipped to handle varying data types:
- **`FlowgraphSinkI16`**: Reads audio data as 16-bit signed integers.
- **`FlowgraphSinkI32`**: Reads data as 32-bit signed integers.
- **`FlowgraphSinkFloat`**: Consumes and processes 32-bit floating-point data.
- **`FlowgraphSinkI24`**: Handles packed 24-bit signed integer data where each sample is 3 bytes.

Each type of sink is implemented over a base `FlowGraphSink` class that acts as the terminal node within a graph, employing `FlowGraphPortFloatInput` to seamlessly pull and process data.

## Key Features
- **Versatile Formats**: Supports multiple common audio data formats.
- **Graph-based Processing**: Uses a pull-model to efficiently manage flowgraph execution, optimizing for real-time data handling.
- **Scalability**: Designed to integrate seamlessly into larger audio processing frameworks.

## Usage
Create an instance of a specific sink (e.g., `FlowgraphSinkI16`) with a designated channel count, then employ the `read()` function to pull frames from the graph:

```rust
let sink = FlowgraphSinkI16::new(2); // Stereo
let mut buffer: Vec<i16> = vec![0; buffer_size];
sink.read(buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *mut c_void, buffer_size);
```

## Getting Started
To integrate Aloe Oboe Flowgraph Sink into your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-flowgraph-sink = "0.1.0"
```
