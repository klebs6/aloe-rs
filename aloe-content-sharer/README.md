# Aloe Content Sharer

Aloe Content Sharer is a Rust crate providing an advanced interface for seamless content sharing across applications and devices. This abstraction accommodates sharing text, images, files, or any arbitrary data block with ease and efficiency.

## Overview

Incorporating the `ContentSharer` struct, this crate allows users to initiate sharing operations on different operating systems, with specific considerations for both Android and iOS environments. The core mechanisms rely on efficient handling of files and memory, ensuring a clean and responsive interface for sharing operations.

## Features
- Share text, files, images, and arbitrary data between applications.
- Handles image sharing by converting images to temporary PNG files.
- Customizable with callbacks for action completion status.
- Platform-specific optimizations for Android and iOS implementations.

## Usage

Utilize the `ContentSharer` to initiate sharing:
```rust
// Create an instance of ContentSharer
let mut sharer = ContentSharer {
    // Initialization with necessary parameters
};

// Share files with a callback function
sharer.share_files(&[Url], |success, message| {
    println!("Shared files: {} - {}");
});

// Share text similarly
sharer.share_text(&"Hello World!".to_string(), |success, message| {
    println!("Shared text: {} - {}");
});
```

## Implementation Details

- **Error Handling**: Returns a success flag and a potential error message. Note that Android reporting might be inaccurate due to platform constraints.
- **Resource Management**: Automatically deletes temporary files post sharing.

Note: This README file was generated by an AI model, and while it strives for accuracy, human verification is recommended for critical uses.

This crate is a translation of the JUCE module.

JUCE is a c++ software framework for developing high performance audio applications.

Usage falls under the GPLv3 as well as the JUCE commercial license.
