# Aloe Concertina

Aloe Concertina is a GUI component library for the Rust programming language designed to facilitate the creation of dynamic and interactive panel stacks typically known as concertina panels.

## Features

- **Dynamic Panels**: Organize components in a vertically stackable manner with adjustable headers allowing for easy expansion and contraction.
- **Customizability**: Offers flexible panel arrangements with customizable headers and component interactivity.
- **Extensible Animation**: Provides smooth animation transitions when resizing or moving panels, customizable per requirement.

## Usage

This rust crate provides an API that simplifies the integration of concertina-style panels into any GUI application. The primary structures introduced are `ConcertinaPanel`, `ConcertinaPanelHolder`, and `ConcertinaPanelSizes`.

### Structures

- **ConcertinaPanel**: This struct handles a collection of components stackable vertically and offers API for adding, removing, or modifying individual panels. It can manage resizing and reordering programmatically or through user interactions such as mouse clicks.

- **ConcertinaPanelHolder**: Each panel in the concertina stack is contained within a holder that manages its component's lifecycle and ensures proper responsiveness to graphical interface events such as mouse-hover and clicks.

- **ConcertinaPanelSizes**: Represents the sizes, minimum, and maximum bounds for each panel, allowing easy runtime adjustments and maintaining size constraints during interactions.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_concertina::ConcertinaPanel;

let mut concertina = ConcertinaPanel::default();
let component = /* some GUI component */;

// Add a component to concertina
concertina.add_panel(-1, component, true);

// Change size of a specific panel
concertina.set_panel_size(component, 200, true);

// Maximize a component within concertina
concertina.expand_panel_fully(component, true);
```

## Installation

To use `aloe-concertina`, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
