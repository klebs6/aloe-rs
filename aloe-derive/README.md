# aloe-derive

The `aloe-derive` crate provides a suite of procedural macros designed to facilitate effective interoperability between Rust and various external interfaces.

### Procedural Macros Overview

- **`ALOE_VECTOR_CALLTYPE`**: Utilized for vector calltype operations, integrating seamlessly with external systems requiring vector-oriented interfaces.
- **`leak_detector`**: Implements leak detection mechanisms, ensuring robust memory management in cross-platform applications.
- **`no_copy`**: Prevents implicit copying, useful in scenarios where high memory efficiency and explicit ownership are prioritized.
- **`dllexport`**: Facilitates exporting functions for DLL creation, enabling dynamic linking in system-level development.
- **`WINAPI`, `JNICALL`, `JNIEXPORT`**: Supports Windows and Java Native Interface (JNI) standards, optimizing function call conventions for respective platforms.
- **`no_move`**: Restricts object movement, promoting predictable behavior in concurrency-sensitive applications.
- **`PLUGIN_API`, `SMTG_OVERRIDE`, `SMTG_EXPORT_SYMBOL`**: Tailored for plugin API development, enhancing modularity and interface standardization.
- **`weak_referenceable`**: Grants weak reference capabilities, essential for managing cyclic dependencies in complex systems.

More advanced macros provide additional, highly specialized functionality within the Rust FFI and COM environments, promoting interface integrity and flexibility.
