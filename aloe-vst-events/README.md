# Aloe VST Events

Aloe VST Events is a Rust crate providing a comprehensive suite of interfaces and structures for handling event processing within the VST (Virtual Studio Technology) framework. This crate facilitates communication between digital audio workstations (DAWs) and VST plugins, enabling them to efficiently manage MIDI events, audio processing commands, and plugin-specific protocol interactions.

## Features

- **VST Event Flags & Types**: Enumerations for identifying and categorizing VST events including note on/off, polyphonic pressure, and custom data events.
- **Event Management**: Traits for handling VST events efficiently, including event scheduling, triggering, and management of deferred updates.
- **Bus Management**: Structures and interfaces for managing audio and event busses, providing detailed bus descriptions and configurations.
- **Interoperability**: Designed for seamless integration within audio processing pipelines, maintaining adherence to VST specifications and interoperability with host-DAW systems.

## Usage Example

```rust
use aloe_vst_events::{VstEvent, VstEventTypes};

fn handle_event(event: VstEvent) {
    match event.ty {
        VstEventTypes::kNoteOnEvent => {
            println!("Note On Event Detected");
        }
        _ => {
            println!("Other Event");
        }
    }
}
```
