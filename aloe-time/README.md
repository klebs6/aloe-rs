# Aloe Time

Aloe Time is a Rust crate designed for precise time management and manipulation. With support for absolute and relative time representations at fine-grained precision, it serves as an essential tool for performance monitoring, time formatting, and system timing operations.

## Features

- **Absolute Time**: Represent exact moments in time with millisecond precision. Suitable for timestamping and date-time calculations.
- **Relative Time**: Measure durations with high accuracy using floating-point seconds, enabling easy arithmetic on time quantities.
- **Scoped Time Measurement**: A robust RAII system for timing code execution, capturing elapsed time in seconds with precision.

## Usage

Use `Time` for capturing the current system time with detailed formatting options and conversion utilities. With `ScopedTimeMeasurement`, leverage deterministic lifetime management for code block execution timing. The `RelativeTime` structure simplifies working with time intervals.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_time::{Time, ScopedTimeMeasurement, RelativeTime};

fn main() {
    let mut time_sec = 0.0;
    {
        let _measurement = ScopedTimeMeasurement::new(&mut time_sec);
        // Perform operations
    }
    println!("Operation took {:.6} seconds", time_sec);
}
```

### Calculation

- Add, subtract, and compare time objects with intuitive arithmetic operations built-in for both `Time` and `RelativeTime`.

### Formatting

- Format times based on ISO-8601 standards, and convert between multiple time descriptions with versatile methods.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-time = "0.1.0"
```
