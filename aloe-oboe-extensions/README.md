# Aloe Oboe Extensions

Aloe Oboe Extensions is a Rust crate that provides advanced extensions for managing AAudio streams using the Oboe library. The implementation includes a suite of tools to manipulate the Memory Mapped (MMAP) data path properties of audio streams, allowing for enhanced audio handling in applications that leverages the Android OpenSL/AAudio audio API.

## Features

- **Memory Mapped (MMAP) Policy Management:** Control and query MMAP policies to determine support and enablement status at runtime.
- **Dynamic Function Pointer Loading:** Dynamically loads AAudio function pointers, ensuring that the usage environment is evaluated at runtime.
- **System Property Interaction:** Retrieve integer properties from the system to manage and configure AAudio stream behaviors efficiently.

## Technical Details

This crate interfaces with low-level audio management functions to toggle and verify MMAP path capabilities. It abstracts the complexity of interacting directly with Android’s native audio systems, encapsulating functionality that permits robust configuration of audio stream properties.

### Primary Struct: `OboeAAudioExtensions`

This struct contains function pointers and state flags that are critical for determining the support and usage of MMAP features within the audio subsystem. The struct also provides methods to:

- Determine if MMAP operations are supported.
- Enable or disable MMAP pathways for streaming operations.
- Load required symbols dynamically to interface with the necessary audio subsystems.

## Usage
Integrating Aloe Oboe Extensions into your Rust project requires a minimal configuration. A typical use case involves instantiating the `OboeAAudioExtensions` struct and calling its methods to set or query MMAP related properties.

```rust
use aloe_oboe_extensions::*;

let mut ext = OboeAAudioExtensions::default();

if ext.is_mmap_supported() {
    match ext.set_mmap_enabled(true) {
        0 => println!("MMAP enabled successfully."),
        _ => println!("Failed to enable MMAP."),
    }
}
```

By leveraging the `OboeAAudioExtensions`, developers can fine-tune the audio streaming process, offering application-specific optimizations that can potentially lead to more efficient audio rendering and processing.
