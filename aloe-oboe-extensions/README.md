# Aloe Oboe Extensions

Aloe Oboe Extensions is a Rust crate that provides advanced extensions for managing AAudio streams using the Oboe library. The implementation includes a suite of tools to manipulate the Memory Mapped (MMAP) data path properties of audio streams, allowing for enhanced audio handling in applications that leverages the Android OpenSL/AAudio audio API.

## Features

- **Memory Mapped (MMAP) Policy Management:** Control and query MMAP policies to determine support and enablement status at runtime.
- **Dynamic Function Pointer Loading:** Dynamically loads AAudio function pointers, ensuring that the usage environment is evaluated at runtime.
- **System Property Interaction:** Retrieve integer properties from the system to manage and configure AAudio stream behaviors efficiently.

## Technical Details

This crate interfaces with low-level audio management functions to toggle and verify MMAP path capabilities. It abstracts the complexity of interacting directly with Androidâ€™s native audio systems, encapsulating functionality that permits robust configuration of audio stream properties.

### Primary Struct: `OboeAAudioExtensions`

This struct contains function pointers and state flags that are critical for determining the support and usage of MMAP features within the audio subsystem. The struct also provides methods to:

- Determine if MMAP operations are supported.
- Enable or disable MMAP pathways for streaming operations.
- Load required symbols dynamically to interface with the necessary audio subsystems.

## Usage
Integrating Aloe Oboe Extensions into your Rust project requires a minimal configuration. A typical use case involves instantiating the `OboeAAudioExtensions` struct and calling its methods to set or query MMAP related properties.

```rust
use aloe_oboe_extensions::*;

let mut ext = OboeAAudioExtensions::default();

if ext.is_mmap_supported() {
    match ext.set_mmap_enabled(true) {
        0 => println!("MMAP enabled successfully."),
        _ => println!("Failed to enable MMAP."),
    }
}
```

By leveraging the `OboeAAudioExtensions`, developers can fine-tune the audio streaming process, offering application-specific optimizations that can potentially lead to more efficient audio rendering and processing.
