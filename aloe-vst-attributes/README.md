# Aloe VST Attributes

Aloe VST Attributes is a Rust crate designed to facilitate the integration with VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugin interfaces, specifically focusing on handling attribute lists and stream attributes. This crate provides a structured approach to managing meta-data and XML representations within VST environments. 

## Features

### IAttributeList

The `IAttributeList` trait encapsulates the functionality for key-value pair management, associating various data types (int, float, string, binary) with identifiers. This is crucial for plugins to manage and store stateful data efficiently.

### IStreamAttributes

`IStreamAttributes` provides meta-attributes for streams, allowing plugins to inform and retrieve context-specific information, such as project context or the full file path of presets.

### IXmlRepresentationController

With `IXmlRepresentationController`, plugins can export structured parameter information using XML, adhering to the DTD from Steinberg, enabling enhanced remote (hardware/software) interfacing and control structuring.

## Technical Background

Attributes in VST plugins are vital for dynamic and flexible control of audio module behaviors. By managing configurations and states effectively, developers can create more interactive and responsive audio applications.

XML representation expands the control landscape, enabling sophisticated mapping of parameters to hardware controls, enhancing user experience by leveraging parameter grouping and presentation.

## Usage

This library requires Rust 2024 edition, and is licensed under GPL-3.0. Ensure compatibility with the VST SDK environment to fully leverage its capabilities.

```rust
use aloe_vst_attributes::{IAttributeList, IStreamAttributes, IXmlRepresentationController};

fn main() {
    // Example setup code
}
```
