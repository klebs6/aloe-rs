# Aloe-WAV

Aloe-WAV is a sophisticated Rust library purposefully engineered to facilitate the reading and writing of WAV audio file formats comprehensively. This crate provides robust support for standard WAV handling, including the ability to manipulate complex metadata attributes associated with Broadcast Wave Format (BWAV), cues, regions, and other waveform annotations. The library enables efficient audio data processing through advanced memory-mapped IO optimizations and customizable audio channel configurations.

## Features

- **WAV and BWAV Support:** Streamlines operations related to common WAV files and their broadcast extensions.
- **Metadata Handling:** Read, write, and manipulate various metadata chunks like `bext`, `smpl`, `cue`, `axml`, acid loop chunks, and more.
- **Channel Layouts and Sample Rates:** Supports a wide array of channel layouts and sampling rates, making it adaptable to numerous audio processing conditions.
- **Snapshot-Safe Operations:** Ensures audio integrity with capabilities to update metadata without rewriting entire file contents.
- **Advanced Memory Management:** Benefit from optimized performance with memory-mapped file reading.
- **Custom Audio Formats:** Handle extensible subgroup formats and OGG Vorbis encapsulated within WAV files.

## Usage

To use the library, add this line to your `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
aloe-wav = "0.1.0"
```

## Example

Here's a simple demonstration of how to read a WAV file using Aloe-WAV:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use aloe_wav::WavAudioFormat;

fn main() {
    let file = File::open("test.wav").unwrap();
    let format = WavAudioFormat::default();
    if let Some(reader) = format.create_reader_for(&file, true) {
        println!("Sample Rate: {}", reader.get_sample_rate());
    } else {
        println!("Failed to read WAV file");
    }
}
```
