# Aloe Sample Type

The `aloe-sample-type` crate is a library designed for digital signal processing (DSP) applications, with a focus on managing various sample types and numeric types. This crate provides interfaces and implementations to handle different data paradigms, making it a versatile tool in DSP contexts where flexibility and performance are paramount.

## Features

- **Trait-Based Abstraction**: The crate employs Rust traits (`HasParentType`, `HasNumericType`, `HasSampleType`, `SampleTypeInterface`, and `HasElementType`) to define a flexible and extensible model for handling various data types in DSP applications.
- **Process Specification Structure**: A `ProcessSpec` struct is provided to encapsulate essential DSP algorithm parameters, including sample rate, maximum block size, and number of channels.
- **Integration with SIMD**: The crate supports SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) registers, optimizing performance for vectorized operations.

## Usage

To use this crate, implement the appropriate traits for your types according to your DSP application's requirements. For instance, implement `HasElementType` and `HasNumericType` to define how your custom types integrate with the DSP system.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_sample_type::{HasElementType, SampleTypeInterface};

struct MySample;

impl HasElementType for MySample {
    type Type = f64;
}

impl SampleTypeInterface for MySample {}
```

## Advanced Concepts

- **Numerical and Sample Type Handling**: The crate defines `NumericType<T>`, which is essential in specifying the primitive type behind more complex structures, allowing seamless integration within different DSP data flows.
- **Trait Constraints and Implementations**: It utilizes Rust's powerful type system to enforce constraints at compile-time, ensuring that only correctly structured types can be instantiated.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-sample-type = "0.1.0"
```
