# aloe-oboe-latencytuner

Aloe Oboe Latency Tuner is a Rust crate designed for dynamically adjusting the latency of an output audio stream that uses Oboe, an audio library for Android. It optimizes audio latency by modifying the stream's buffer size, based on observed underruns, within the constraints of application-level buffering.

## Features

- **Dynamic Latency Management**: Automatically adjusts buffer size to optimize for low latency while maintaining audio quality.
- **State Management**: Monitors and operates in different states such as `Idle`, `Active`, `AtMax`, and `Unsupported`.
- **Compatibility**: Specifically designed for streams utilizing AAudio, with operations such as `tune()`, `reset()`, and state inquiries.

## Usage

To utilize `OboeLatencyTuner`, instantiate it with your mutable `OboeAAudioStream` instance. Invoke the `tune()` method right before your data callback returns, if using callbacks, or before `write()` when using blocking writes.

### Example:

```rust
let mut my_stream: OboeAAudioStream = ...;
let mut tuner = OboeLatencyTuner::from(&mut my_stream);
tuner.set_minimum_buffer_size(256);
tuner.set_buffer_size_increment(128);

// Use in audio processing loop
loop {
    // audio processing occurs here
    
    let result = tuner.tune();
    match result {
        OboeResult::OK => println!("Tuning successful."),
        OboeResult::ErrorUnimplemented => println!("Tuning not supported."),
        _ => println!("Tuning error encountered.")
    }
}
```
