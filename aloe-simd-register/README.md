# Aloe SIMD Register

Aloe SIMD Register is a Rust crate providing a robust abstraction over SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, designed for high-performance computing on vectorized data. This crate offers a framework for interfacing with platform-native SIMD registers, allowing for efficient manipulation and computation of data in a highly parallel fashion.

## Overview

The core of the library revolves around the `SIMDRegister` struct, a versatile construct that represents a native vector of elements, supporting most arithmetic and logical operations akin to their scalar counterparts. The crate extensively uses Rust's type system to enforce safe and efficient operations on SIMD types, leveraging traits to define associated types for value, mask, primitive, and native operations.

## Features
- **Trait-driven design**: Defines a comprehensive suite of traits, such as `HasValueType` and `HasMaskType`, to facilitate flexible operations.
- **Generic vector operations**: Provides capabilities such as element-wise minimum (`jmin`), maximum (`jmax`), sum, absolute value, and zeroing out of registers.
- **Alignment guarantee**: Includes utility functions to ensure data is correctly aligned for SIMD, avoiding potential performance bottlenecks.
- **Complex and conditional operations**: Facilitates operations on complex numbers and conditional selections through SIMD mask types.
- **Optimized for parallelism**: Utilizes parallel operations across elements, ideal for numerically intensive calculations.

## Requirements
Ensure that SIMD extensions are available on your target machine using `ALOE_USE_SIMD` environment checks, as non-optimized usage may lead to suboptimal performance.

## Usage
```rust
use aloe_simd_register::SIMDRegister;
let mut float_register = SIMDRegister::<f32>::new(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]);
```
Operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison can be applied element-wise on `SIMDRegister` instances, ideal for fast array processing and vector mathematics.

## Note
Employ optimizations for meaningful performance benefits, harnessing the full capabilities of SIMD processing. Improper usage might not exploit the inherent speed advantages.
