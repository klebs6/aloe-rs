# aloe-audio

The `aloe-audio` crate provides an advanced suite of tools for creating, processing, and managing audio components within Rust applications. This library is focused on rendering audio UIs and integrating audio processing, offering a robust API suitable for both real-time audio synthesis and complex audio processing pipelines.

## Features
- **Audio Component Framework**: Provides UI components for representing audio processors and managing device settings.
- **Synthesizer and Audio Processing**: Introduces audio synthesis and effects processing capabilities, including MIDI input handling.
- **System Audio Control**: Interfaces to control system audio settings such as volume and muting.
- **Real-time Audio Visualization**: Includes a scrolling audio waveform display that visualizes live input audio data.

## Example

```rust
use aloe_audio::{GenericAudioProcessorEditor, AudioSynthesizerDemo};

fn main() {
    // Example usage of the synthesizer demo
    let mut synthesizer = AudioSynthesizerDemo::default();

    // Render the UI or handle audio device callbacks
    // synthesizer.paint(&mut graphics);
    // synthesizer.resized();
}
```

## Use Cases
- **Audio Application Development**: Build applications requiring sophisticated audio processing or live audio feedback loops.
- **Audio Interface Design**: Craft custom audio interfaces with controls such as sliders and toggle buttons to interact with audio processors.

## Integration
This crate is designed to be straightforward to integrate with existing audio frameworks by providing abstract interfaces and utility functions to facilitate audio operations and UI rendering.

## License
`aloe-audio` is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license.
