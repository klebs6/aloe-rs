# Aloe Resizable

Aloe Resizable is a Rust crate designed for building modular, GUI components which provide interactive resizing functionalities. It's ideal for GUI components that require the user to resize windows effortlessly, akin to the familiar resizing handles in modern operating systems.

## Features

- **ResizableEdges:** Provides edges on components for resizing them by dragging.
- **ResizableCorners:** Facilitates resizing when dragged from the component corners.
- **ResizableBorders:** Draws an entire border around the component, allowing adjustment from any side or corner.

### Technical Overview

1. **ResizableEdgeComponent**: Resizes its parent by forming a draggable edge. It necessitates repositioning in sync with parent component size changes.

2. **ResizableCornerComponent**: Emulates the corner resizer seen in many applications, allowing resizing when dragged.

3. **ResizableBorderComponent**: Encapsulates the component in a draggable border frame, enabling resizing from any axis.

### Usage

Begin by including the respective resizer component in your GUI structure, ensuring correct initialization just like attaching typical GUI elements. Always synchronize the resizer position and size related to any component size changes. Optionally, use a `ComponentBoundsConstrainer` to impose size constraints during resizing operations.

#### Example

```rust
let my_component = Component::new();
let edge_resizer = ResizableEdgeComponent::new(&my_component, None, ResizableEdgeComponentEdge::leftEdge);
```

### Dependencies
This crate depends on a compositor and graphics library to render the resizing controls effectively in a GUI.
