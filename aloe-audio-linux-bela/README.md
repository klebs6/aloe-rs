# aloe-audio-linux-bela

`aloe-audio-linux-bela` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate audio device management and operations on Linux-based platforms using the BELA audio environment. This crate abstracts complex audio I/O tasks into more straightforward, programmatically manageable routines.

## Overview

The main components of this library include:

- **`BelaAudioIODeviceType`**: Represents the type of audio I/O device specific to BELA systems, incorporating the manipulation of device names, scanning, and initialization of audio devices.
- **`BelaAudioIODevice`**: An entity handling the operations and state management of audio devices, including channel management, sample rates, and buffer sizes.

### Key Features

- Customize audio device settings to match specific requirements for audio and analog channels.
- Open and close audio devices efficiently to manage resource allocation dynamically.
- Set up callback functions necessary for rendering and cleaning up audio processing routines.

## Usage

Add `aloe-audio-linux-bela` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-linux-bela = "0.1.0"
```

Then you can use the `BelaAudioIODeviceType` and `BelaAudioIODevice` to manage your audio processing:

```rust
use aloe_audio_linux_bela::{BelaAudioIODeviceType, BelaAudioIODevice};

fn main() {
    let mut device_type = BelaAudioIODeviceType::default();
    let mut device = BelaAudioIODevice::default();

    // Setup audio device
    device.open(...);
    if device.is_open() {
        // Start processing audio
        device.start(...);
    }
}
```
