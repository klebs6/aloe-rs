# Aloe VST Channel

Aloe VST Channel is a Rust crate providing interfaces and utility functions that facilitate the integration of VST plugins with host channel contexts. It delivers rich channel information that can be critical for precise audio processing and visualization.

## Overview

This crate focuses on enumerating channel context operations and extracting various properties, aiding in the custom handling of VST plugins based on their channel position and attributes. Key functionalities include:

- **Channel Context Plugin Location**: Defines enumerations for plugin placements such as pre-volume fader or post-volume fader.
- **Automation State Interface**: Allows plugins to ascertain and react to automation states broadcast by the host.
- **Channel Context Interface Listener**: Provides methods for obtaining comprehensive channel context details, including color spec, naming, and indexing operations.
- **ARGB Color Specifications**: Functions to decompose and interpret `ChannelContextColorSpec` into alpha, red, green, and blue components.

## Technical Features

- Implements essential traits for interfacing with VST host environments using the Steinberg API layer definitions.
- Extends `IEditController` facilitating deeper integration and communication with host applications.
- Offers low-level access to intricate channel attributes via VSTâ€™s channel context.

## Usage

To include this crate in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-vst-channel = "0.1.0"
```

Developers can incorporate the provided traits to enhance their plugins' interoperability with host applications, thereby simplifying audio management tasks that depend on channel context, leading to more robust plugin implementations.
