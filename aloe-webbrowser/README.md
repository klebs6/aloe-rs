# Aloe WebBrowser

Aloe WebBrowser is a flexible and extensible Rust crate designed to embed a web browsing component within applications across multiple platforms. By leveraging platform-specific web technologies, it provides an abstraction over diverse underlying web engines such as WebKit on Mac, iOS, and Linux, and options between Internet Explorer and Microsoft WebView2 on Windows.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Web Engine Support**: Supports WebKit on macOS, Linux, and iOS, and options for either IE or WebView2 on Windows platforms with a conditional compilation feature, `ALOE_USE_WIN_WEBVIEW2`.
- **Event Hooking**: Implements a robust interface allowing hooking into various web events, such as page loading, network errors, and window interactions.
- **Command-Driven Control**: Provides a command-driven interface for fine-grained control over navigation and browser operations.

## Usage

To embed a browser using `aloe-webbrowser`, you first need to initialize the `WebBrowserComponent`, optionally specifying unload behavior when the browser is hidden:

```rust
let browser = WebBrowserComponent::new(Some(true));
```

You can navigate to URLs using:
```rust
browser.go_tourl(&String::from("https://www.example.com"), None, None);
```

### Handling Events
Implement the `PageAboutToLoad`, `PageFinishedLoading`, `PageLoadHadNetworkError`, and other traits to respond to browser events as needed:

```rust
impl PageAboutToLoad for MyWebApp {
    fn page_about_to_load(&mut self, new_url: &String) -> bool {
        println!("Navigating to: {}", new_url);
        true // Return whether to proceed with loading
    }
}
```

## Requirements
- **Linux**: Requires GTK and WebKit2GTK packages.
- **Windows**: WebView2 requires the presence of WebView2Loader.dll and Microsoft Edge (version 82.0.488.0 or higher).

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-webbrowser = "0.1.0"
```
