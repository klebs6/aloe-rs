# Aloe Scanning

**Aloe Scanning** is an advanced crate for managing and organizing audio plugin types, enhancing the discovery, scanning, and manipulation of audio plugins. It is particularly useful in audio software development, where handling numerous plugins efficiently can be a challenge.

## Features

- **Plugin Management:** Offers structures and methods to manage audio plugins, including addition, removal, and sorting by various attributes such as category, manufacturer, and format.
- **Scanning and Sorting:** Provides facilities for scanning directories for plugins, iteratively scanning files or identifiers, and sorting plugins by multiple criteria, including alphabetical order and file system location.
- **Asynchronous Scanning:** Supports asynchronous scanning, allowing for multi-threaded plugin discovery and management, enhancing performance for large plugin sets.
- **Blacklist Management:** Includes utilities for managing blacklisted files, improving stability by excluding problematic plugin files from being considered.
- **Plugin Trees:** Builds hierarchical representations of plugins, allowing for organized, tree-based views of available plugins.

## Concepts and Usage

Aloe Scanning is built around several core structures and traits:

- **`KnownPluginList`:** Central structure managing a list of known plugin types, enabling functionality for editing, sorting, and scanning.
- **`PluginDirectoryScanner`:** Scans specified directories and files for audio plugins, handling both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
- **`KnownPluginListSortMethod`:** Enum defining various sorting methods applicable to plugin lists.
- **`PluginSorter`:** Facilitates sorting of plugins based on specified criteria.

### Example
Here is a simplified illustration of sorting a list of plugins alphabetically:
```rust
let mut plugin_list = KnownPluginList::default();
plugin_list.sort(KnownPluginListSortMethod::sortAlphabetically, true);
```

## Data Structures
- **`KnownPluginListPluginTree`:** Provides a hierarchical tree structure for organizing plugins by folders or categories.
- **`PluginDescription`:** Contains metadata about each plugin, facilitating sorting and scanning decisions.

## Building a Plugin Tree by Category
This advanced capability allows developers to create a structured, hierarchical list of plugins sorted by category or manufacturer, making it easier to locate desired plugins and understand the organization's landscape of available audio tools.

## Goals
The primary goal of Aloe Scanning is to seamlessly manage audio plugin types, facilitating extensive flexibility in organizing, searching, and updating plugins, thus streamlining audio application development and enhancing productivity.

This crate is a translation of the JUCE module.

JUCE is a c++ software framework for developing high performance audio applications.

Usage falls under the GPLv3 as well as the JUCE commercial license.

See github.com/juce-framework/JUCE and the JUCE license page for details.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. As such, some of its features may be pending-translation. For progress updates, please see the workspacer rust project. workspacer contains a growing set of utilities designed specifically for rust projects.
