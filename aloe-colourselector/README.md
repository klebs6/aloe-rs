# Aloe ColourSelector Crate

Aloe ColourSelector is a Rust crate designed for advanced graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where color selection is a pivotal feature. Built for versatility and precision, this crate provides a comprehensive set of tools for selecting and manipulating colors within an application, utilizing various components like sliders and color spaces.

## Features

- **Color Manipulation**: Change colors of GUI elements using customizable color IDs.
- **RGB and HSV Support**: Utilize sliders and color spaces to select colors based on RGB and HSV models.
- **Swatches Management**: Save and apply frequently used colors with swatch components.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Leverage components for hue selection, color preview, and more, facilitating modular and scalable development.
- **Change Broadcasting**: Notify listeners of color changes dynamically.

## Technical Overview

The crate provides an enum, `ColourSelectorColourIds`, defining color ID constants to modify keyboard visual elements via `Component::setColour()` or `LookAndFeel::setColour()`. It follows a trait-based design, with key traits such as:

- `ColourSelectorInterface`: A marker for color selector capabilities.
- `GetNumSwatches`, `GetSwatchColour`, `SetSwatchColour`: Manage color swatches for easy selection and application.

Components like `ColourPreviewComp` and `HueSelectorComp` allow rich, interactive controls for vibrant GUI applications. The hue selector, for instance, lets users drag to adjust hue with immediate visual feedback.

Each component is tailored with meticulous design to ensure seamless integration into existing Rust projects while supporting modern GUI requirements.
