# Aloe Audio Processor

Aloe Audio Processor is a powerful Rust crate designed to provide a flexible base class for audio processing components, such as plugins or internal modules. It offers a comprehensive interface for developing and managing complex audio processing tasks with support for VST, AU, RTAS, and other plugin standards.

## Features

- **Flexible Base Class**: Serve as a foundation for custom audio processors, enabling seamless integration with major plugin standards.
- **Plugin Hosting**: Acts as a wrapper around loaded plugins, facilitating plugin management and execution.
- **Bus Management**: Provides comprehensive bus layout and configuration capabilities for both input and output audio streams.
- **Precision Control**: Supports flexibility in precision-mode selection to cater to varying processing requirements.
- **Performance Optimization**: Employs atomic operations and fine-grained critical sections for thread-safe processing.

## Getting Started

To use Aloe Audio Processor, you should implement your own class derived from `AudioProcessor`, providing the necessary logic for your specific audio processing needs. If you are building a plugin, include a global function `createPluginFilter()` that instantiates your subclass.

For more details, consult the [documentation](https://github.com/klebs6/aloe-rs).

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-audio-processor = "0.1.0"
