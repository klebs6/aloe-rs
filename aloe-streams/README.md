# Aloe Streams

Aloe Streams is an extensible Rust crate designed for efficient data stream processing, embodying comprehensive functionalities for both input and output stream manipulation. The architecture enables seamless data reading and writing, founded on a base set of interfaces that support subclassing to provide tailored behavior.

## Features

- **InputStream Interface**: Base class for all input streams with support for reading bytes, strings, various data types, and more.
- **OutputStream Interface**: Provides facilities for writing data to different destinations, including in-memory buffers and external sources.
- **Buffered Input Streams**: Enhance data access efficiency by reading large chunks and caching them.
- **Memory Input/Output Streams**: Direct interaction with memory blocks for high-speed operations.
- **Subregion Streams**: Read specific sections of a stream independently.

## Usage

To utilize the capabilities of Aloe Streams, implement the desired interfaces in your structs and override the virtual functions to match your streaming needs whether itâ€™s reading from a file, writing to a buffer, or processing data in real-time. Aloe Streams accommodates both synchronous and potentially future extensions to asynchronous workflows.

Example for implementing a custom `InputStream`:
```rust
pub struct MyInputStream {
    // Fields as needed
}

impl InputStream for MyInputStream {
    fn read(&mut self, dest_buffer: *mut c_void, max_bytes_to_read: usize) -> isize {
        // implementation details
    }
    // implement other methods...
}
```

Get started by integrating Aloe Streams into your project to foster fine-grained control over data stream operations, enabling robust, flexible, and high-performance applications.
