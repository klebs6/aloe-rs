# aloe-flexbox

A comprehensive Rust library for managing and applying flexbox layout principles in GUI applications. With `aloe-flexbox`, you can organize your application's graphical components with the same flexibility and power given by CSS Flexbox, allowing for dynamic, responsive interfaces that easily adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

## Features

- **Flexible Alignment Options**: Utilize options for `alignItems`, `alignSelf`, `justifyContent`, and more to tailor the layout to specific needs.
- **Direction and Wrapping Control**: Control layout flow with `flexDirection` and manage item wrapping with `flexWrap`.
- **Parameterization of Layout**: Each `FlexBox` can be customized with justify content, direction, and wrapping parameters suited to your design intent, ideal for constructing advanced user interfaces.

## Usage

Here is a basic example illustrating how to set up a `FlexBox`:

```rust
use aloe_flexbox::{FlexBox, FlexItem, FlexBoxDirection, FlexBoxAlignItems, FlexBoxWrap, FlexBoxJustifyContent};

fn main() {
    let mut flexbox = FlexBox::new(
        FlexBoxDirection::row,
        FlexBoxWrap::wrap, 
        FlexBoxAlignContent::stretch,
        FlexBoxAlignItems::center, 
        FlexBoxJustifyContent::spaceBetween,
    );

    let item1 = FlexItem::default().with_flex_with_grow(1.0);
    flexbox.items.push(item1);

    flexbox.perform_layout_with_target_area(Rectangle::new(0.0, 0.0, 500.0, 300.0));
}
```
