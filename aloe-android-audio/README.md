# Aloe Android Audio

A Rust crate designed for leveraging OpenSL ES audio functionality on Android devices. This library provides a structured interface to manage audio session lifecycles and handle audio in real-time applications. It is especially tailored to the needs of audio processing and media applications necessitating low latency audio interface.

### Key Features

- **OpenSL ES Integration:** Provides traits and structures aligned with Android's OpenSL ES audio functionality.
- **Real-time Audio Processing:** Structures designed to support real-time audio processing applications with an emphasis on low latency interactions.
- **High Performance Paths:** Functions facilitating the detection and use of high-performance audio paths, including low latency configurations.
- **Session Management:** Comprehensive session management allowing for the creation, configuration, and cleanup of audio session resources.
- **Support for Multiple Sample Formats:** Designed to accommodate both integer and floating-point audio data, allowing applications to utilize the most suitable format for their requirements.

### Example Usage

```rust
#[cfg(target_os="android")]
pub struct OpenSLAudioDeviceType {
    base: AudioIODeviceType,
}

// Usage: Initialize and manage audio session
let mut audio_device = OpenSLAudioDeviceType::default();
audio_device.scan_for_devices();

// Open device interface
let device = audio_device.create_device("output_device_name", "input_device_name");
if device.is_open() {
    device.start(...);
}
```
