# Aloe-MPE Crate

Aloe-MPE is a Rust library designed for handling MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) in an MPE-compatible environment. It provides robust mechanisms to track and manage expressive MIDI data, allowing complex manipulations for advanced music synthesis. The crate is tailored for musically-inclined developers and researchers aiming to harness the capabilities of MPE.

## Features

- **MPEInstrument**: Manage MPE note states, using pressure, pitchbend, and timbre dimensions for nuanced control.
- **MPESynthesizer**: Interface for musical synthesis, equipped with voice stealing and polyphony handling.
- **User-defined Interfaces**: Implement custom audio rendering by creating subclasses of provided interfaces.
- **Zone Management**: Define and manipulate MIDI zones tailored for expressive control, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of MIDI devices.

## Usage
To use the Aloe-MPE crate, include it in your project by adding it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-mpe = "0.1.0"
```

Import the library into your Rust code:

```rust
use aloe_mpe::*;
```

## Example

```rust
use aloe_mpe::{MpeInstrument, MpeSynthesizer, MPENote};

let mut synthesizer = MpeSynthesizer::default();
let mut instrument = MpeInstrument::default();

// Configure zones
instrument.set_zone_layout(default_zone_layout());

// Add voices to the synthesizer
synthesizer.add_voice(Box::new(MySynthVoice::default()));

// Set up MIDI processing
let midi_message = // ... MIDI message acquisition logic;
instrument.process_next_midi_event(&midi_message);

// Render audio with the synthesizer
let mut audio_buffer = // ... AudioBuffer instantiation;
synthesizer.render_next_block(&mut audio_buffer, 0, buffer_size);
```
