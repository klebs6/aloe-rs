# Aloe Audio Processor Editor

Aloe Audio Processor Editor is a Rust crate that specializes in providing a graphical user interface (GUI) framework for audio processing applications. Designed to be highly extensible and modular, it enables developers to create sophisticated audio editor components seamlessly.

## Core Features

- **Audio Processor Interface**: Integrates with the main audio processing engine to manage and manipulate audio effect parameters.

- **MIDI Controller Support**: Facilitates interaction with MIDI controllers, allowing for dynamic and responsive control of audio parameters.

- **Component Interaction and Events**: Supports a variety of component event listeners and interactions, enabling reactive and interactive GUI designs for audio processors.

- **GUI Components**: Provides pre-built UI components such as sliders, toggle buttons, and combo boxes, which can be attached to audio parameters for intuitive controls.

## Structs and Traits Overview

- **`AudioProcessorEditor`**: Acts as the main GUI component for the audio processor, with support for resizing, component attachment, and peer updating.

- **`AudioProcessorEditorListener`**: Monitors events related to components, allowing responsive updates and actions.

- **`AttachedToggle`**, **`AttachedSlider`**, **`AttachedCombo`**: Facilitates the connection between GUI elements and audio parameters, streamlining parameter changes through user interaction.

- **MIDI Integration Traits**: Provides traits for checking MIDI controller availability and interacting with host MIDI controllers.

## Example Usage

To leverage the functionality of `aloe-audio-processor-editor`, a developer needs to derive their GUI components from the `AudioProcessorEditor` struct. Further customization of UI behavior can be achieved through the provided listener and attachment structs for components such as sliders and buttons.
