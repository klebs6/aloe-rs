# Aloe Audio Block

Aloe Audio Block is a Rust crate providing a minimal and lightweight data structure designed to manage and manipulate audio sample buffers without owning the underlying data. It focuses on providing flexible views into sample data for processing tasks, ensuring high performance through effective use of pointers and data access optimizations.

## Features

- **Non-Owning Data Structure**: The `AudioBlock` structure operates as a view over audio data, providing raw pointer access without taking ownership. This approach allows for advanced memory management schemes by the user of the crate.
- **Channel Count Management**: The `AudioBlock` supports multi-channel audio processing, defining interfaces for handling channel counts and channel data pointers.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Comprehensive support for element-wise mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., making it suitable for digital signal processing.
- **Customizable Alignment**: Users can specify data alignment for performance optimization, which is essential for SIMD operations and other low-level optimizations.

## Usage

The `AudioBlock` can be instantiated from various backing storage methods, such as directly from allocated memory, heap blocks, or external audio buffers. Here is a simple example to illustrate its usage:

```rust
// Assuming you have an external buffer or raw data...
let mut audio_data: Vec<f32> = vec![0.0; 1024]; // Example audio data buffer
let number_of_channels = 2;
let number_of_samples = 512;

let audio_block = AudioBlock::<f32>::new_from_channel_data(
    audio_data.as_mut_ptr(),
    number_of_channels,
    number_of_samples
);
```

### Note

This crate is intended for users who are comfortable dealing with raw pointers and manual memory management practices. As such, it provides the flexibility needed for advanced audio applications at the cost of increased responsibility for memory safety.

## Safety and Performance

- **SIMD Considerations**: The crate includes considerations for SIMD operations, although it's subject to conditional compilation features like `ALOE_USE_SIMD` for optimal performance on supported architectures.
- **Responsibility of Memory Management**: While `AudioBlock` provides powerful operations, it relies heavily on the user to maintain memory validity through its lifecycle.
