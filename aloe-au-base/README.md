# Aloe AU Base

Aloe AU Base is a comprehensive Rust crate that abstracts the Audio Unit (AU) architecture, providing a quintessential framework for developing audio processing modules in Rust. It offers seamless integration with the AU ecosystem through a structured interface, optimizing performance for real-time audio applications.

## Key Interfaces

### AU Input Element

The `AUInputElementEInputType` enum delineates the types of input sources available: none, connection-based, or callback-based.

### Core Traits

- **`SetStreamFormat`**: Manages the configuration of audio streams, ensuring compatibility and optimization.
- **`NeedsBufferSpace`**: Determines if buffer space is essential, enabling efficient memory management.
- **`AUElementInterface`**: Provides comprehensive control over parameter enumeration and audio element configuration.
- **`CanScheduleParameters`**: Affirms the possibility of parameter scheduling, offering advanced automation capabilities.

### Advanced Features

The crate supports complex render operations through the `AUComplexRender` trait, facilitating intricate processing workflows. Moreover, it allows detailed manipulation of audio parameters, giving developers granular control over audio properties.

## Usage

Integrate the crate into your project by adding it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-base = "0.1.0"
```

Import the necessary traits and structures in your code:

```rust
use aloe_au_base::{AUElementInterface, SetStreamFormat};
```

Harness the full potential of AU processing with Aloe AU Base, your definitive solution for audio unit implementation in Rust.
