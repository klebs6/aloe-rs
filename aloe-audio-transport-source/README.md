# Aloe Audio Transport Source

Aloe Audio Transport Source provides an adaptive audio playback interface capable of controlling complex audio sequences. It enables users to manipulate audio streams with precision, featuring start/stop controls, gain adjustments, and sample rate handling. This implementation is ideal for scenarios requiring high-fidelity audio manipulation, including game engines, simulations, and digital audio workstations.

## Features

- **Positionable Audio Source Integration**: Seamlessly interfaces with `PositionableAudioSource` for intuitive audio positioning.
- **Advanced Buffer Management**: Employs buffering strategies and background threading to ensure smooth audio playback, even in varied system conditions.
- **Sample Rate Correction**: Facilitates audio playback across different sample rates, maintaining pitch fidelity.
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Utilizes locks and atomics for safe concurrent audio operations.
- **Gain Control**: Flexible dynamism in modulating audio amplitudes.

## Overview

With the `AudioTransportSource`, manage audio playback by setting input sources, adjusting playback positions, and leveraging audio streams efficiently. Designed to work harmoniously with `AudioSourcePlayer` and `AudioIODevice`, it is a critical component for any sophisticated audio framework.

### Example Code

To initialize and use the `AudioTransportSource`:

```rust
use aloe_audio_transport_source::{AudioTransportSource, AudioSource, PositionableAudioSource};

// Initialization and configuration of the transport source
todo!(); // Placeholder for actual source setup

let mut transport_source = AudioTransportSource::default();
transport_source.set_source(...); // Configure the source as per requirements
```
