# Aloe Scrollbar

Aloe Scrollbar is a comprehensive Rust library for handling scroll bar components with advanced user interaction capabilities, designed for high-performance graphic user interface (GUI) applications. This crate features highly customizable scroll bars that respond to user inputs and can be managed programmatically via an intuitive API.

## Features

- **Event Listener:** Utilize the `ScrollBarListener` trait to monitor scroll bar movements, capturing changes in bar position dynamically.
- **Configurable Ranges:** Establish precise range limits with `setRangeLimits()` to define the scrollable area, and `setCurrentRange()` to adjust the thumb position and size.
- **Orientation Control:** Seamlessly transition between vertical and horizontal orientations, adapting to different layouts and screen configurations.
- **Auto-Hide Functionality:** Intelligent visibility management allows the scroll bar to auto-hide when unnecessary, reducing screen clutter.
- **Keyboard and Mouse Interaction:** Supports a variety of user input methods including keystrokes and mouse gestures for efficient navigation.

## Usage

To integrate Aloe Scrollbar into your project, include it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-scrollbar = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

Below is a brief example demonstrating basic usage:

```rust
use aloe_scrollbar::{ScrollBar, ScrollBarListener};

struct MyScrollListener;

impl ScrollBarListener for MyScrollListener {
    fn scroll_bar_moved(&mut self, scroll_bar_that_has_moved: *mut ScrollBar, new_range_start: f64) {
        println!("Scrollbar moved to: {}", new_range_start);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut scrollbar = ScrollBar::new(false);
    scrollbar.set_range_limits(0.0, 100.0, None);
    scrollbar.set_current_range(10.0, 30.0, None);

    let mut listener = MyScrollListener;
    scrollbar.add_listener(&mut listener);
}
```
