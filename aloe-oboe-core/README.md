# Aloe Oboe Core

A Rust crate providing core components for high-performance audio processing on Android devices. It offers a robust interface to interact with audio streams, ensuring precise control over aspects such as performance mode, input preset, sample rate conversion quality, and audio format. This library effectively bridges the gap between native audio capabilities and user applications through harmonious integration with Android's audio attributes and policies.

## Overview

The `aloe-oboe-core` crate facilitates advanced audio management by defining enums and traits that model various attributes of audio streams. Key components include:

- `OboePerformanceMode`: Optimizes audio stream performance based on latency and power requirements.
- `OboeInputPreset`: Specifies the default audio source and configuration, akin to MediaRecorder. 
- `OboeSampleRateConversionQuality`: Balances CPU load and conversion quality.
- `OboeSharingMode`, `OboeAudioFormat`, `OboeContentType`: Customize stream sharing, format and content type.
- Comprehensive error handling using `OboeResult` and `OboeResultWithValue`.
- `OboeStreamState` and `OboeChannelCount` for managing stream lifecycle and channel specifications.

## Usage

This crate simplifies audio operations by utilizing predefined enums that align with Android API standards, especially for users targeting API 28+. Incorporate the `OboeSessionBaseInterface` to manage audio session basics like start and stop operations proficiently.

```rust
use aloe_oboe_core::*;

let oboe_stream = OboeAudioStream::new();
oboe_stream.start();
```
