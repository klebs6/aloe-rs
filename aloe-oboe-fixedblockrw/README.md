# Aloe-Oboe-FixedBlockRW

Aloe-Oboe-FixedBlockRW is a Rust crate designed for efficient conversion between variable-sized and fixed-sized data blocks. It is particularly suitable for audio processing tasks where input and output data flows require precise buffering to fixed block sizes for optimized performance.

## Overview

The crate provides core components to handle data buffers:

- **FixedBlockProcessor**: A trait for processing fixed-size blocks.
- **FixedBlockWriter**: Converts a variable-sized push data flow into a fixed-size buffer, ideal for audio inputs.
- **FixedBlockReader**: Transforms a fixed-size pull data flow into variable-sized blocks, suited for audio outputs.
- **FixedBlockAdapter**: A base class to manage conversion and buffering operations between variable and fixed sizes.

### Key Features

- **Buffer Alignment**: Ensures that both fixed and variable blocks maintain alignment, usually a multiple of certain bytes, ensuring high compatibility across systems where block size matters.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Handles internal resource allocation and deallocation, minimizing overhead and maximizing performance.
- **Error Handling**: Returns comprehensive error codes when operations fail, enhancing reliability.

## Usage

Integrate the crate into your Rust project via `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-fixedblockrw = "0.1.0"
```

Implement the `FixedBlockProcessor` trait in your application to customize how each data block is processed,
and use `FixedBlockWriter` and `FixedBlockReader` for data conversion.

```rust
// Example of an implementor of FixedBlockProcessor
pub struct MyBlockProcessor;

impl FixedBlockProcessor for MyBlockProcessor {
    fn on_process_fixed_block(&mut self, buffer: *mut u8, num_bytes: i32) -> i32 {
        // Process the buffer here
        num_bytes // Return number of bytes processed
    }
}
```

Leverage the writer and reader to tackle complex data flow requirements within audio applications.
