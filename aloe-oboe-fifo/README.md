# Aloe Oboe FIFO

Aloe Oboe FIFO is a highly efficient library for managing circular buffers with support for concurrent read and write operations using atomic counters. The crate provides robust abstractions for handling read and write indices in FIFO structures, accommodating non-contiguous data due to the circular nature of the buffer. It employs atomic counters for thread-safe operations, making it suitable for high-performance, concurrent applications.

## Features

- Manages read/write indices in circular buffers.
- Handles non-contiguous data efficiently.
- Supports both direct and indirect counter management.
- Thread-safe operations with atomic constructs.

## Concepts

This crate provides an implementation to handle and manipulate a circular buffer using FIFO (First In First Out) methodology. The crate emphasizes atomic operations to facilitate safe concurrent usage in multithreaded environments. The design focuses on maximum performance with minimal locking by utilizing atomic counters for indexing operations.

### FifoControllerBase
The core component managing the indices and capacity of the buffer:
- `get_frame_capacity`: Retrieves the buffer's frame capacity.
- `get_full_frames_available`: Computes the total number of full frames ready for processing.
- `get_empty_frames_available`: Determines available space for new frames without overflow.

### FifoController
Inherits from `FifoControllerBase`, integrating atomic counters for internal management.

### FifoBuffer
Contains storage management, handling ownership and direct memory operations. Offers high-level operations:
- `read` and `write`: Seamlessly handle buffer read and write operations while managing non-contiguous data scenarios.

## Usage
To use Aloe Oboe FIFO, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-fifo = "0.1.0"
```

In your code, you can create new FIFO buffer objects, configure buffer capacities, and interact with read/write functionalities as needed.

```rust
use aloe_oboe_fifo::FifoBuffer;

let mut fifo_buffer = FifoBuffer::new(4, 1024);  // 4 bytes per frame, capacity for 1024 frames
let read_capacity = fifo_buffer.get_buffer_capacity_in_frames();
println!("Buffer capacity: {} frames", read_capacity);
```
