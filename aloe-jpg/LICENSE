 INDEPENDENT JPEG GROUP (IJG) LICENSE CLUSTER - SINGLE COMMENT BLOCK

 This unified text covers the standard IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licensing
 statements repeated in the original snippet across multiple files, such as:
   jcapimin.c, jcapistd.c, jccoefct.c, jcdctmgr.c, jchuff.c, jcinit.c, etc.,
   as well as jerror.h, jerror.c, and the "README" references typically found
   in an IJG distribution.

 The authors commonly appear as: Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding, and the
 Independent JPEG Group. Key references show the years 1991-1998, among others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The typical license statement used by the IJG is:

   This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

   Copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
   This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.

   For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
   (Often also referencing "jerror.h" or "jerror.c" for error code details.)

   The gist of the terms is that the software is provided "AS IS", with no
   warranty of any kind, express or implied.  Permission to use, copy,
   modify, and distribute this software for any purpose without fee is
   granted, as long as certain conditions in the README are met.  The
   disclaimers disclaim all warranties, including merchantability and fitness
   for a particular purpose, and disclaim liability for any damages.

 Over time, additional statements or disclaimers might appear, but they all
 revolve around the same core license used by the IJG. The key points are:

   1) This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
   2) Permission is granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software
      for any purpose, subject to the disclaimers in the README.
   3) The authors disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of
      merchantability and fitness.

 For complete details, please refer to the official Independent JPEG Group
 documentation and the README included with the source distribution.

 Consolidated here, it forms a single robust license cluster for the IJG code.

 Consolidating references from:
   - png.h (libpng version 1.6.37 - April 14, 2019), plus older historical
     text referencing 1995-2019 disclaimers
   - Additional lines from pngrutil.c, pngread.c, pngrio.c, etc.
   - The “PNG Reference Library License version 2” and version 1 text blocks

 The disclaimers and license references collectively include:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) PNG Reference Library License version 2, referencing:

     Copyright (c) 1995-1996 Guy Eric Schalnat, Group 42, Inc.

     The software is supplied "as is", without warranty of any kind, express
     or implied. No claim of merchantability or fitness for a particular
     purpose is made. In no event shall the copyright owners or contributors
     be liable for any damages. Permission is granted to use, copy, modify,
     and distribute this code under certain conditions. See the full text
     in the official license statements.

  2) Detailed BSD-like terms from the older “PNG Reference Library License
     version 1,” for libpng 0.5 through 1.6.35 (with references to disclaimers
     from Group 42, Inc., Andreas Dilger, Guy Eric Schalnat, Glenn
     Randers-Pehrson, etc.).

  3) The standard statement:

     "The PNG Reference Library is supplied 'AS IS'. The Contributing Authors
      and Group 42, Inc. disclaim all warranties, expressed or implied,
      including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability and
      of fitness for any purpose. The Contributing Authors and Group 42, Inc.
      assume no liability for direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary,
      or consequential damages, which may result from the use of the PNG
      Reference Library, even if advised of the possibility of such damage."

  4) Additional notes on PNG usage, references to:
     https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/src/libpng-LICENSE.txt
     and mention that usage is permitted under the stated terms (similar
     to a BSD 3-clause license).

 By merging all references, we preserve the full disclaimers, including
 names, years, domain references, and disclaimers. This block serves as
 the single consolidated license text for libpng from the original snippet.
