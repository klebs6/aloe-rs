# Aloe Vst Units

`aloe-vst-units` is a Rust crate designed for handling VST 3.0 unit and program list management in digital audio processing. It provides a comprehensive implementation of interfaces that facilitate efficient communication between VST plugins and hosts regarding unit assignments, unit data, program lists, and their associated metadata.

The crate includes several core traits:

- **IUnitHandler2**: This trait allows notifying the host of changes in unit assignments by the bus. Implementing this interface helps in managing dynamic changes efficiently.

- **IUnitData**: Provides facilities for handling unit preset data. It allows users to get or set unit data, crucial for managing presets and maintaining state across sessions.

- **IProgramListData**: Facilitates access to program list data and interacts seamlessly with `IUnitData` for managing program lists associated with units.

- **IUnitHandler**: Enables communication with the host for notifying changes in unit selections and program list changes. This interface is key for coherence between plugin and host state.

- **IUnitInfo**: Essential for describing the internal structure of the plugin. It manages unit counts, information, and associations with program lists.

## Features
- **Host and Plugin Communication**: Seamless handling of interactions required for advanced unit management.
- **Unit and Program Handling**: Integrates deep management of both units and program lists.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Unlike static configurations, plugin interactions can dynamically adjust to host-notified changes, maintaining synchronization with the creative workflow.

## Getting Started
To use `aloe-vst-units`, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-vst-units = "0.1.0"
```

### Example
Implementing `IUnitHandler2` might look like this:

```rust
use aloe_vst_units::IUnitHandler2;

struct MyHandler;

impl IUnitHandler2 for MyHandler {
    fn notify_unit_by_bus_change(&mut self) -> tresult {
        // Notify logic here
    }
}
```
