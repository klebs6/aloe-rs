# Aloe-Android Crate

## Overview

The `aloe-android` Rust crate is designed to interface seamlessly with Android's multimedia capabilities, specifically focusing on Bluetooth MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) connections. It facilitates communication and interaction with Android devices via MIDI through Bluetooth, positioning itself as a robust solution for audio and media applications.

## Features

- **MIDI Device Management:**
  - Enumerate and manage Bluetooth MIDI connections with Android devices.
  - Handle MIDI device connection statuses using the `AndroidBluetoothMidiDeviceConnectionStatus` and manage pairings with `AndroidBluetoothMidiInterfacePairStatus`.

- **Android Interface Implementation:**
  - Implement various Android interface callbacks, including lifecycle, layout change, and media scanner connections.
  - Seamlessly integrate Android components through SurfaceHolder, ContentSharer, and FragmentOverlay interfaces.

- **Multimedia Support:**
  - Supports file sharing through content provider systems.
  - Utilize media scanner connection interfaces to manage media presence.

- **Activity Lifecycle Management:**
  - Detailed activity lifecycle control through `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks`, ensuring consistent state across Android application components.

## Usage

Add `aloe-android` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-android = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

```rust
use aloe_android::{AndroidBluetoothMidiInterface, SurfaceHolderCallbackInterface};

struct MySurfaceCallback;
impl SurfaceHolderCallbackInterface for MySurfaceCallback {
    fn surface_changed(&mut self, holder: LocalRef<jobject>, format: i32, width: i32, height: i32) {
        // Implement your code here
    }
    fn surface_created(&mut self, holder: LocalRef<jobject>) {
        // Implement your code here
    }
    fn surface_destroyed(&mut self, holder: LocalRef<jobject>) {
        // Implement your code here
    }
}

let midi_interface = AndroidBluetoothMidiInterface::new();
let my_surface_callback = MySurfaceCallback;
```
