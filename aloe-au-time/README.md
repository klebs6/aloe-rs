# aloe-au-time

`aloe-au-time` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate the generation of audio timestamps, managing the continuity and precision necessary for high-fidelity audio processing environments such as CoreAudio on macOS. It abstracts complexities involved in maintaining a continuous timeline through potential disruptions or discontinuities, such as those resulting from audio engine resets or overloads.

## Features

- **Timestamp Generation**: Utilizes a robust algorithm to produce a sequence of continuously increasing timestamps despite upstream discontinuities.
- **Discontinuity Management**: Correctly handles interruptions or changes in audio streams, ensuring seamless operation.
- **Platform Specific Time Operations**: Exploits the macOS CoreAudio capabilities for precise time management, with fallback implementations available for other platforms.
- **Host Time Base Utilities**: Includes functions for converting host times to and from nanoseconds, and managing time frequency operations.

## Usage

Include `aloe-au-time` in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-time = "0.1.0"
```

Utilize the `AUTimestampGenerator` to manage your audio timelines:
```rust
use crate::AUTimestampGenerator;

let mut timestamp_gen = AUTimestampGenerator::new(Some(true));
timestamp_gen.reset();

// Configure as needed
timestamp_gen.set_start_input_at_zero(true);

// Process timestamps -- iteratively
timestamp_gen.add_output_time(&audio_timestamp, expected_frames, output_rate, Some(1.0));
let input_time = timestamp_gen.generate_input_time(frames_to_advance, input_rate, Some(false));
```
