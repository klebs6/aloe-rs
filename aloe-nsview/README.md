# Aloe-nsview

Aloe-nsview is a Rust crate specifically for macOS, empowering developers with the capability to manage and utilize NSViews in audio plugin contexts. This library provides structured components and utilities for handling Cocoa's NSViews when integrating with VST2 and VST3 plugins, ensuring seamless interfacing for UI elements.

### Key Components

- **NSViewComponentWithParent**: This struct encapsulates an NSView serving as the parent view for plugin editors.
  - **@note**: This component does not auto-resize based on the owned view’s bounds. Instead, plugins must leverage their dedicated interfaces to adjust the editor size, typically via the `setSize` method in appropriate callbacks.

- **FlippedNSView**: A helper struct that emulates an NSView with flipped coordinates, simplifying integration with complex UI layouts.

- **Async Interactions**: The crate provides mechanisms through methods like `handle_async_update` to maintain UI consistency amidst various events such as new subview additions or window changes.

### Usage

To create a new instance of an NSView component with an optional nudge feature:
```rust
let component = NSViewComponentWithParent::new(NSViewComponentWithParentWantsNudge::yes);
```

To handle plugin instance creations:
```rust
let component = NSViewComponentWithParent::new_from_instance(&mut instance);
```

### Advanced Features

- **FlippedNSView Default Implementation**: Integrates with Objective-C to provide flipped view handling.

- **View Lifecycle Notifications**: Employs various hooks such as `did_add_subview` and `view_did_move_to_superview` to respond to view changes, enabling the correct UI state adjustments.

This crate is a translation of the JUCE module.

JUCE is a c++ software framework for developing high performance audio applications.

Usage falls under the GPLv3 as well as the JUCE commercial license.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. As such, some of its features may be pending-translation. For progress updates, please see the workspacer rust project. workspacer contains a growing set of utilities designed specifically for rust projects.
