# Aloe Multiband

Aloe Multiband is a Rust crate designed for advanced multiband audio processing. It leverages the power of Linkwitz-Riley filters to split audio signals into low and high frequencies while enabling precise gain adjustments in each band.

## Features
- **High-Precision Filtering**: Utilizes Linkwitz-Riley filters for seamless crossover between frequency bands.
- **Gain Control**: Independent gain stages for low and high-frequency bands, facilitating nuanced audio tuning.
- **Buffer Management**: Efficiently handles audio buffering to support real-time processing.
- **Generic Float Support**: Supports any floating-point type that implements the `num::Float` trait, providing flexibility across different accuracy requirements.

## Usage
```rust
use aloe_multiband::MultiBandProcessor;

let mut processor = MultiBandProcessor::<f32>::default();
// Configure the processor with the desired settings...
processor.prepare(&spec);
processor.process(&mut context);
```

## Implementation Insights
The `MultiBandProcessor` structure is the core component, encapsulating filter objects and gain controls. The process method effectively demonstares real-time processing by managing input and output through a context object.

### Example Code Snippets
The crate currently outlines planned functionality through placeholders (`todo!()`). However, the overall design is clear, focusing on real-time multiband signal processing.
