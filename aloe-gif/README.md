# Aloe GIF Crate

The `aloe-gif` crate is a versatile and efficient library for parsing and decoding GIF images in Rust. Designed with a focus on handling GIF-specific data structures efficiently, this crate supports loading and processing GIFs in environments excluding macOS and iOS with Core Graphics and Core Image.

## Features

- **Efficient GIF Decoding**: Utilizes LZW compression algorithms to decode GIFs efficiently.
- **Palette Management**: Manages a palette with up to 256 ARGB entries, allowing for crisp color representation.
- **Interlacing Support**: Includes functionalities to process interlaced GIFs, ensuring correct image display.
- **Extensible Interface**: Provides a flexible interface that facilitates integration with various input sources through dynamic references to the `Read` trait.

## Example Usage

```rust
use std::io::Read;
use aloe_gif::GIFLoader;

let mut file: &mut dyn Read = // your dynamic Read here;
let mut loader = GIFLoader::new(file);

let mut width = 0;
let mut height = 0;
if loader.get_size_from_header(&mut width, &mut height) {
    println!("GIF dimensions: {}x{}", width, height);
    // further processing
}
```

## Internal Structure

The `GIFLoader` struct encapsulates stateful components needed for GIF processing, including:
- **Image**: Representation of the current image state.
- **Buffer and Palette**: Arrays for data storage and color information.
- **Decoding State**: Variables to maintain decoding state, such as `current_bit` and `code_size`.

## Advanced Usage

Advanced operations such as data block reading and table handling are encapsulated within dedicated methods. The crate ensures optimal performance through direct buffer manipulation and control mechanisms for adaptive LZW decoding.

This crate is a translation of the JUCE module.

JUCE is a c++ software framework for developing high performance audio applications.

Usage falls under the GPLv3 as well as the JUCE commercial license.

See github.com/juce-framework/JUCE and the JUCE license page for details.

This crate is in the process of being translated from c++ to rust. As such, some of its features may be pending-translation. For progress updates, please see the workspacer rust project. workspacer contains a growing set of utilities designed specifically for rust projects.
