# Aloe Processor Chain

Aloe Processor Chain is a Rust crate for constructing and managing heterogeneous audio processing chains. This crate provides a flexible and efficient framework, allowing you to build complex signal processing workflows by chaining multiple audio processors, each optionally bypassable, into a unified structure. 

### Features

- **Processor Chaining**: Create a sequence of audio processors where each processor can be dynamically accessed and modified.
- **Bypass Control**: Flexibly enable or disable individual processors within the chain.
- **Non-member Function Access**: Use non-member equivalents to access and control processor states, avoiding complex member template syntax.
- **Reset and Prepare**: Manage processor states across chains efficiently with unified reset and preparation routines.

### Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-processor-chain = "0.1.0"
```

### Usage
Below is a basic example demonstrating how to use the `ProcessorChain`:

```rust
use aloe_processor_chain::{ProcessorChain, get, set_bypassed, is_bypassed};

let mut chain = ProcessorChain::new();

// Assume `MyProcessor` implements `AudioProcessorInterface`
chain.add_processor(Box::new(MyProcessor::new()));

// Process audio context
chain.process(&mut audio_context);

// Bypass the first processor
set_bypassed::<0>(&mut chain, true);

// Check if the processor is bypassed
assert!(is_bypassed::<0>(&chain));
```
