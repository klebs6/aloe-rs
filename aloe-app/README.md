# Aloe App Crate

Aloe App is a Rust crate for managing application runtime permissions and building dynamic user preferences panels similar to Mac-style GUI interfaces. It provides tools for creating applications that can run event loops and handle GUI interactions, primarily targeting environments requiring complex permission management such as Android.

## Features

- **Runtime Permissions Management**: Handle permissions like audio recording, Bluetooth MIDI, and storage access, with abstracted functions converting between platform-specific and universal formats.
- **Dynamic Preferences Panels**: Create and manage preference panels with GUI button selections to switch between different settings pages.
- **Application Lifecycle Management**: Oversea application lifecycle events including initialization, shutdown, background suspension, and multi-instance management.

## Usage

To use this crate, implement traits like `CreateComponentForPage`, `PreferencesPanelInterface`, and extend `ALOEApplication` to define your application logic and GUI layout. Utilize `RuntimePermissions` to request and manage necessary permissions, especially on Android platforms.

In Android environments, runtime permissions are critical for functionality like audio recording. This crate offers a seamless way of requesting these permissions and integrates callbacks for handling grant results.

## Installation

Add Aloe App as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-app = "0.1.0"
```
