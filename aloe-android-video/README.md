# Aloe Android Video

Aloe Android Video is a Rust crate providing a comprehensive interface for video management in Android applications. It integrates tightly with the Android Media framework, enabling seamless interaction between Rust and Java components.

This crate defines a robust architecture featuring state-aware media session management, audio focus handling, video rendering, and callback interfaces for media events. It provides a rich API for managing video playback, including actions like play, pause, seek, volume adjustment, and audio focus change monitoring.

### Key Concepts

- **MediaSessionPlayerState**: Enumerates the various states of media playback such as initialised, playing, paused, and completed, allowing fine-grained control over the playback lifecycle.

- **MediaPlayerListener & AudioManagerOnAudioFocusChangeListener**: Traits allowing implementers to respond to key media events such as preparation, buffering, completion, errors, and audio focus changes.

- **MediaSessionPlayer & MediaSession**: Core structures responsible for managing the playback state and audio focus, leveraging Android's media APIs.

- **VideoComponentImpl**: Integrates with Android's SurfaceHolder for rendering video and managing lifecycle events.

### Installation
Include this crate in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-android-video = "0.1.0"
```

### Usage

Implement the `MediaPlayerListenerOwner` and `AudioManagerOnAudioFocusChangeListenerOwner` traits in your application to handle media events:

```rust
impl MediaPlayerListenerOwner for MyApp {
    fn on_prepared(&mut self, media_player: &mut LocalRef<jobject>) {
        // Handle media preparation
    }
    // Implement other required methods...
}

impl AudioManagerOnAudioFocusChangeListenerOwner for MyApp {
    fn on_audio_focus_change(&mut self, change_type: i32) {
        // Handle audio focus changes
    }
}
```

Create a `MediaSessionPlayer` instance and control playback:

```rust
let mut media_session = MediaSessionPlayer::new(&mut my_media_session);
media_session.load(&media_id, &extras);
media_session.play();
```
