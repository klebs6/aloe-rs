# Aloe Memory

`aloe-memory` is a Rust library offering advanced memory management utilities, including reference counting, weak references, and singleton patterns, specifically catered towards applications that require precise control over memory resources.

## Features

- **Reference Counting**: Easily add reference-counting capabilities to your objects, providing automatic memory management in multithreaded environments.
- **Weak References**: Generate weak references that become null automatically when the referenced object is deleted.
- **Singletons**: Utilize macros to implement singletons efficiently and safely, including multithreaded and single-threaded variants.
- **Heap Management**: Manage dynamic memory allocations with classes like `HeapBlock` and `MemoryBlock`, providing array management and alignment functionalities.
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Employ tools such as `HeavyweightLeakedObjectDetector` for robust memory leak detection and management.
- **Scoped Pointers**: Implement `OptionalScopedPointer` to handle object lifetimes effectively, similar to C++'s RAII paradigm.

## Usage

To use `aloe-memory`, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-memory = "0.1.0"
```

### Example

Reference Counting Example:

```rust
use aloe_memory::{ReferenceCountedObject, ReferenceCountedObjectPtr};

struct MyObject {
    ref_counted_obj: ReferenceCountedObject,
}

impl ReferenceCountedObject for MyObject {
    // Implement necessary trait methods
}

let obj = ReferenceCountedObjectPtr::new(MyObject { ref_counted_obj: ReferenceCountedObject::default() });
```
