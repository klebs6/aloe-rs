# `aloe-oboe-sles`

An advanced Rust library for audio development, `aloe-oboe-sles` provides a structured interface for managing audio streams with OpenSL ES. It integrates high-performance functionality suitable for creating robust audio applications. The library offers capabilities for both input and output audio streams, leveraging FIFO buffers and exposing various configurations for customized audio handling. This library is designed for developers who need to exploit low-level audio capabilities on supported systems.

## Features

- **Buffered and Non-buffered Stream Management**: Offers streaming with and without FIFO buffers for blocking and non-blocking I/O operations.

- **OpenSL ES Integration**: Deep integration with OpenSL ES for creating and managing audio players and recorders. Ensures high compatibility and performance on relevant platforms.

- **Flexible Audio Configuration**: Allows configuration of audio playback and recording settings, such as format and channel mask, tailored for both legacy and modern APIs.

- **Advanced State Management**: Provides detailed mechanisms to manage stream states (e.g., playing, paused, stopped) robustly.

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-oboe-sles = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_oboe_sles::{OboeAudioStreamBufferedInterface, OboeAudioStreamOpenSLES};

// Example of creating and managing an audio stream
fn main() {
    // TODO: Add initialization and operational code
}
```
