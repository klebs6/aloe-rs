`aloe-treeview` is an advanced Rust library for creating and managing a tree view component in GUI applications. It provides an interface and several traits for interacting with a hierarchy of items, each of which can be customized with various features and behaviors. The crate supports both static and dynamic data structures and allows for operations such as item selection, drag-and-drop, and customization of item rendering.

## Features

- **Flexible Hierarchy Management**: Organize items in a parent-child relationship with sub-items support.
- **Customizable Rendering**: Implement custom rendering for items, including open/close buttons, connecting lines, and more.
- **Selection Handling**: Support for multi-selection and notification on item selection changes.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Interfaces for handling drag-and-drop actions for items, including file drops.
- **Accessibility**: Support for accessibility features, including tooltips and names.

### Example

```rust
use aloe_treeview::{TreeView, TreeViewItem, TreeViewItemOpenness};

struct MyTreeViewItem;
impl TreeViewItemInterface for MyTreeViewItem {}

let tree_view = TreeView::new("My Tree");
