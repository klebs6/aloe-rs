# aloe-au-dispatch

A Rust crate for interfacing with audio unit components, providing a sophisticated hierarchical lookup system for audio methods and component factories. This crate is designed for use in intricate audio applications where dynamic audio processing and MIDI interaction are essential.

The `aloe-au-dispatch` library allows developers to leverage Audio Unit (AU) components through defined lookup tables and factories. By utilizing generic factory patterns, this crate abstracts complex AU method routing tasks for efficient audio processing.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Lookups:** The crate provides multiple lookup structures (`AUBaseLookup`, `AUOutputLookup`, etc.) for resolving audio component methods based on selectors.
- **Factory Patterns:** Structure audio component creation through `AUBaseFactory`, aiding in organized and scalable application design.

## Usage

To get started with `aloe-au-dispatch`, include it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-dispatch = "0.1.0"
```

Structure your project to utilize method lookup features via the provided interfaces. Implement diverse audio processing techniques based on the modular lookup architecture.

```rust
use aloe_au_dispatch::{AUBaseLookup, AUBaseFactory, AudioComponentMethod};

fn main() {
    // Example of initializing a lookup component
    let mut lookup = AUBaseLookup {};
    // Work with audio components
    if let Some(method) = lookup.lookup(kAudioUnitRenderSelect as i16) {
        // Execute audio processing method
    }
    // Utilize factories for audio component instantiation
}
```
