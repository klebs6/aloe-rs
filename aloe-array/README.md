# Aloe Array

The `aloe-array` crate provides advanced array management capabilities for Rust developers seeking an efficient and flexible container for both primitive and complex types. It offers a versatile array implementation with thread-safe variants and various functionalities for managing, sorting, and manipulating array contents.

## Features
- **Templates and Traits**: Utilize Rust traits and generics to abstract over different parameter and lock types, facilitating a highly customizable usage pattern.
- **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage with dynamic allocation and various resizing strategies for efficient storage management.
- **Manipulation and Access**: Provides a comprehensive suite of methods to add, remove, compare, and index elements. Ensures thread safety with critical section types where necessary.
- **Sorting and Querying**: Methods for sorting using customizable comparators and efficient search operations.
- **Interoperability**: Designed to facilitate conversion and interaction between different array and pointer types, often using move semantics to ensure performance efficiency.

## Usage
Designed for advanced application developers, the `aloe-array` crate is suitable for performance-critical applications, such as game development, simulations, and real-time data processing, where dynamic arrays form the backbone of data storage and processing.

### Quick Example
```rust
use aloe_array::Array;

fn main() {
    let mut array: Array<i32> = Array::new();
    array.add_ref(&10);
    array.add_new_element(20);
    array.insert(1, 15);

    assert_eq!(array.size(), 3);
    assert!(array.contains(15));
    array.remove_index(0);
}
```
