# Aloe Random

Aloe Random is a highly versatile and efficient random number generator implemented in Rust. It facilitates the creation and manipulation of random numbers, geared toward developers requiring deterministic or non-deterministic random sequences in their systems. 

## Key Features
- **Seed Management**: Initialize with a specific seed for predictable sequences or generate one using system properties for enhanced randomness.
- **Various Outputs**: Generate integers, floats, Booleans, and BigIntegers across different ranges seamlessly.
- **Thread Safety**: Use local instances for thread-safe operations, isolating random number streams across different use cases.
- **Memory Operations**: Fill memory buffers with random values efficiently.

## Usage
Create a `Random` instance with either a default or specified seed:
```rust
let mut rng = Random::default(); // Uses a randomly generated seed
let mut rng_with_seed = Random::new(42); // Uses the seed '42'
```

Generate various types of random values as required:
```rust
let random_int = rng.next_int();
let random_float = rng.next_float();
let random_bool = rng.next_bool();
let random_int_in_range = rng.next_int_with_range(0..10);
```

## Thread Safety
For multithreaded applications, instantiate separate `Random` objects in each thread to prevent corruption of randomly generated values.
