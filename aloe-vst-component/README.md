# Aloe VST Component Crate

Aloe VST Component provides a base framework for creating VST 3.0 plugins. This crate encapsulates foundational interfaces and structures for plugin and host communication, focusing on media processing and parameter control. Semantic abstractions of key VST concepts guide the user in implementing audio processing chains with efficiency.

## Features
- Implements core VST 3.0 interfaces like `VstIComponent`, `IEditController`, and `IComponentHandler`.
- Supports various bus configurations and formats through enums such as `VstMediaTypes` and `VstBusDirections`.
- Provides scalable I/O capabilities with interfaces like `IConnectionPoint`.
- Facilitates parameter manipulation and host interaction using `IEditController` methods.
- Offers high level of flexibility with traits and structures to extend any VST 3.0 plugin functionality.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` to use Aloe VST Component in your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-vst-component = "0.1.0"
```

## Example
```rust
use aloe_vst_component::*;

struct MyComponent {
    // implements VstIComponent and other necessary traits
}

impl VstIComponent for MyComponent {
    // Implement interface methods
}

// Example function to get bus
fn example_get_bus(component: &mut impl VstIComponent, bus_type: MediaType, direction: BusDirection) {
    let count = component.get_bus_count(bus_type, direction);
    // Further processing
}
```
