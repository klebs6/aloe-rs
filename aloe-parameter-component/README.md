## Overview

In contemporary audio processors, parameters play a vital role in adjusting various aspects of the audio signal processing chain. `aloe-parameter-component` is crafted to facilitate the encapsulation and rendering of parameter components like sliders, toggle buttons, and combo boxes. This modular and scalable crate ensures that the parameters are organized in a user-friendly and visually coherent interface.

## Components

- **ParametersPanel**: Acts as a container for parameter components, arranged to be easily accessible and manageable.
- **ParameterListener**: Observes changes in parameters and propagates updates efficiently to other components.
- **SwitchParameterComponent**: Facilitates binary state representation through buttons, ideally suited for toggling settings.
- **BooleanParameterComponent**: For parameters that require true/false inputs, utilizing a toggle button interface.
- **SliderParameterComponent**: Provides intuitive linear or nonlinear slider input field for continuous parameters.
- **ChoiceParameterComponent**: Manages a selection of options through dropdown menus for discrete parameter values.
- **ParameterDisplayComponent**: An overarching component to present parameter name, value, and a graphical representation.

## Usage

To employ this crate, instantiate any of the provided components and pass your `AudioProcessor` and associated parameters. Each component comes with methods to initialize, layout, and customize behavior according to your logical requirements.

```rust
let mut processor = // your setup;
let parameters = // your parameters;
let mut panel = ParametersPanel::new(&mut processor, &parameters);
```

## Features

- **Dynamic and Responsive UI**: Adaptable parameter display options for precise and aesthetic control handling.
- **Concurrent Parameter Listening**: Efficient change propagation via the parameter listener design pattern.
- **Customizable**: Leverage constructors and setter methods to adapt components to unique needs and stylistic preferences.
- **State Management**: Integrates reliably with audio states, enabling seamless end-host interaction.
