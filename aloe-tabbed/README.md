# Aloe Tabbed

Aloe Tabbed is a Rust crate providing a sophisticated and adaptable tabbed component for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It allows developers to create multitab interfaces efficiently by integrating a `TabbedComponent` and `TabbedButtonBar` that automatically manage the layout and behavior of tab-based navigation systems.

## Features

- **TabbedButtonBarOrientation:** Define the position of your tab bar with options such as `TabsAtTop`, `TabsAtBottom`, `TabsAtLeft`, and `TabsAtRight`.
- **TabbedComponentColourIds:** Customize with color IDs, enabling personalized backgrounds and outlines.
- **UI Customization:** Add additional components within tabs, customizing their placement relative to the tab text.
- **Callback and Integration Support:** Implement traits such as `PopupMenuClickOnTab`, `CreateTabButton`, `GetBestTabLength`, and `CurrentTabChanged` to integrate interactive behaviors.

## Usage

Configure your GUI by creating a `TabbedComponent` and populating it with tabs via `addTab(...)`. Customize tab appearance and behavior with several configuration methods:

```rust
let mut tabbed_component = TabbedComponent::new(TabsAtTop);
tabbed_component.add_tab("Tab 1", Colour::from_rgb(200, 200, 255), my_component, true, None);
```

The layout and behavior of tab bars can be further adjusted using methods like `setOrientation`, `setMinimumTabScaleFactor`, and `setOutline`.
