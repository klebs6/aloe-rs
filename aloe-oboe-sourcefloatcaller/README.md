# Aloe Oboe SourceFloatCaller

Aloe Oboe SourceFloatCaller is an advanced Rust library for audio source management using callback mechanisms for dynamic data handling. Designed to optimize audio data flow and processing, this crate is ideal for high-fidelity audio applications requiring precise control over audio data pipelines.

## Features

- **Dynamic AudioSource Handling**: Utilize callback methods to seamlessly read and manage audio data from input and output streams with minimal latency.
- **Type-Specific Processing**: Support for multiple audio data types including 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit integers, and floating point conversions, allowing developers to choose the right format for their application.
- **Efficient Data Conversion**: Includes optimized routines for converting audio data formats ensuring high-quality audio transformations.
- **Stabilized Callbacks**: Implements stabilized callbacks that ensure consistent processing times through dynamic workload adjustment, crucial for real-time audio applications.

## Usage

```rust
use aloe_oboe_sourcefloatcaller::OboeSourceI16Caller;

fn main() {
    // Example of setting up a new audio source caller.
    let mut audio_source = OboeSourceI16Caller::new(2, 512);
    // Set the stream and process audio frames
    // audio_source.set_stream(...);
    let frames_processed = audio_source.on_process(1024);
    println!("Processed {} frames", frames_processed);
}
```

## Getting Started

To get started, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
