# Aloe Audio Unit Component Crate

Welcome to the `aloe-au-component` Rust crate. This crate is designed for advanced audio component management primarily targeting macOS platforms.

## Overview

This crate facilitates interaction with Audio Unit (AU) components and serves as a bridge for component management in audio applications. It encapsulates core interactions between component management utilities, allowing fast and efficient dispatch of audio unit operations.

Key features include:
- **Component Management**: Enables efficient handling and dispatching of component instances.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Provides traits for pre and post constructor/destructor operations to manage object lifecycle effectively.
- **Platform-Specific Implementations**: Contains optimized code paths for macOS with conditional compilation directives to ensure cross-platform compatibility where necessary.

## Key Structures and Traits

### `ComponentBase`
- **Purpose**: Represents the fundamental building block of the audio component.
- **Methods**: Includes methods for instance management, type determination, and lifecycle control.

### Component Lifecycle Traits
- **`AUPreConstructor`** and **`AUPostConstructor`**: Managed initialization steps before and after creating component instances.
- **`AUPreDestructor`** and **`AUPostDestructor`**: Provide safe and orderly destruction of audio components.

### Component Management Utilities
- **`ComponentInitLocker`**: Protects instance construction using mutexes to ensure thread safety on macOS.

## Usage

To integrate `aloe-au-component` into your Rust project, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-component = "0.1.0"
```

Ensure you have set up macOS development environment if using platform-specific features.
