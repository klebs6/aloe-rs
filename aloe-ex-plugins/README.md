# Aloe Ex Plugins

## Overview

Aloe Ex Plugins is a comprehensive Rust crate designed to facilitate advanced audio processing and synthesis capabilities. It leverages high-performant abstractions to manage audio effects, sample processing, and MIDI control.

This crate provides various components including audio processors, synthesis voices, and audio format readers. It is highly customizable and serves as a robust foundation for building intricate audio applications, be it standalone instruments or effects plugins.

## Key Components

- **MPESamplerVoiceDirection & LoopMode:** Enumerations representing sample voice direction and loop modes, crucial for defining audio playback and loop strategies.
- **MeterListener & EmbeddedUI:** Traits designed to monitor audio levels and handle embedded user interface messages for integrated audio processors.
- **AudioProcessor Architectures:** A collection of audio processor structures such as `AloeDemoPluginAudioProcessor` and `IAAEffectProcessor` which provide foundational processing logic.
- **Integration and Control:** Features like `MPESettingsDataModel` and `VisibleRangeDataModel` assist in handling MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) configurations and visual range adjustments.

## Getting Started

To integrate Aloe Ex Plugins into your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-ex-plugins = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

This crate is designed for developers with an understanding of audio signal processing and Rust's trait system. Implement the provided traits to create custom audio processors or synth voices:

```rust
use aloe_ex_plugins::{MPESamplerVoiceDirection, LoopMode, MeterListener};

struct MyProcessor;

impl MeterListener for MyProcessor {
    fn handle_new_meter_value(&mut self, _0: i32, _1: f32) {
        // Custom handling of meter values
    }
}
```
