# Aloe AU Types

Aloe AU Types provides foundational data structures and operations critical for managing thread safety, vector unit detection, and atomic operations in high-performance computing environments. This crate features a sophisticated abstraction over mutexes, spinlocks, atomic stacks, and a comprehensive suite of vector unit checks tailored for capabilities like SSE, AVX, and Neon.

## Features

- **Thread-safe Lists and Iterators:** Facilitates robust handling of concurrent operations with deferred add/remove/clear capabilities, ensuring efficient manipulation of collections in multi-threaded contexts.

- **Vector Unit Typing and Detection:** Enumerates vector unit types and provides utility functions to detect CPU-specific capabilities like SSE3 or AVX, crucial for applications needing detailed hardware profiling and capability detection.

- **Atomic Operations:** Implements atomic operations using platform-specific atomic functions with barriers, ensuring memory safety and synchronization across threads without resorting to locks.

- **Reference Management:** Includes reference-counted objects and automatic memory managers like `CAAutoFree` and `CAAutoArrayDelete`, simplifying dynamic memory management and garbage collection.

- **Exception Handling:** Provides extended exception types for capturing detailed error states, vital for robust error handling and debugging in complex systems.

## Example Usage

```rust
use aloe_au_types::CAMutex;

fn main() {
    let mut mutex = CAMutex::new(b"ExampleMutex".as_ptr());
    // Lock the mutex
    if mutex.lock() {
        // Perform thread-safe operations
        mutex.unlock();
    }
}
```

## Installation

Include the following in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aloe-au-types = "0.1.0"
```
